<h2>PREFACE</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Dear Boys</span>:&mdash;Those of you who have read
the earlier volumes in this series of backwoods
stories may remember that I half-promised to
follow the &#8220;Pioneer Boys on the Great
Lakes&#8221; with a third volume. I now have the
pleasure of presenting that story to you. In
it you will renew your acquaintance with the
two stout-hearted lads of the border, Bob and
Sandy Armstrong, as well as several other
characters you met before, some of whose
names have become famous, and are recorded
in the history of those early days that &#8220;tried
men&#8217;s souls.&#8221; Besides this, there are some
new characters introduced, who, I hope, will
appeal to your interest.</p>

<p>It was hardly to be expected that such a
restless spirit as that of David Armstrong,
the Virginia pioneer who built his log cabin
on the bank of the beautiful Ohio, would long
rest contented when wonderful stories constantly
reached his ears concerning the astonishing
fertility of the black soil, as well as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
abundance of fur-bearing animals, to be found
in the valley of the great river which De Soto
had discovered&mdash;the mighty Mississippi; and,
as you will learn, his first serious set-back
caused him to start upon another long pilgrimage
toward the &#8220;Promised Land.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was this constant rivalry among the early
settlers, this never-ending desire to find better
homesteads in the new country, always toward
the setting sun, that gradually peopled our
Middle West, and finally reached out far across
the plains to the shore of the Pacific.</p>

<p>Trusting that you may enjoy reading the
present volume, and that at no distant day
we may again renew our acquaintance, believe
me, dear readers, to be,</p>

<div class='sig'>
<span style="margin-right: 4em;">Cordially yours,</span><br />

<div class='adtitle2'>The Pioneer Boys of the<br />
Mississippi</div>



<h2>CHAPTER I<br />

<small>CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP</small></h2>


<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Paddle</span> harder, brother. The current is
stronger than I ever knew it to be before.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, Bob, we must be very near the place
where we always land when we come over to
look after our traps?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Once we are in the lee of that point ahead,
Sandy, we can go ashore. The river is so high
that it&#8217;s hard to recognize the old landmarks.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Both together, then, Bob. There! that
looks like business! and, just as you say, our
dugout can lie safely under the shelter of that
tongue of land, while we&#8217;re off &#8217;tending our
traps. Another week, and we must stop setting
any snares, for the fur will be getting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
poor; so Pat O&#8217;Mara said the last time he
came to the settlement.&#8221;</p>

<p>Five minutes later, the two Armstrong boys
sprang ashore on the Ohio side of the river, at
a little distance below the spot where, across
the now unusually wide stream, their parents,
together with other bold pioneers from Virginia,
had, not more than a year before, started
a frontier settlement.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>The clumsy, but staunch boat, fashioned
from the trunk of a tree, was drawn partly
out of the water. They had made the passage
of the river with considerable hard labor, because
of the vast volume of water which the
heavy spring rains had brought out of the hills
all the way up to and beyond old Fort Duquesne.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>Both boys were dressed after the fashion of
that time among hunters and trappers, who,
scorning the homespun clothes of the Virginia
settlers, found garments made of buckskin,
not unlike those worn by many of the
Indians, to give them the best service when
roaming the great forests that stretched from
the Alleghanies, off to the border of the mighty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
Mississippi, in the &#8220;Land of the Setting
Sun.&#8221;</p>

<p>Having picked up their guns, the brothers
started through the thick woods; but not before
Sandy, the younger, had cast a last wistful
look back at the swollen waters of the Ohio,
that, seen in the dull light of the overcast
afternoon, flowed steadily toward the west.
Truth to tell, that unknown western region
was drawing the thoughts of the pioneer boy
very much of late; and, even as he tramped
along at the side of Bob, his first words told
how he envied the rushing waters that were
headed into the country he longed to see.</p>

<p>&#8220;Abijah Cook is back at the settlement for
a short spell, I heard Mr. Harkness say,&#8221; he
remarked, with a long sigh that caused his
brother to turn an uneasy glance in his direction.</p>

<p>&#8220;And has he given up ranging the woods
with young Simon Kenton?&#8221; the older boy
asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! no; but he brought his winter&#8217;s catch
of pelts in for Mr. Harkness to dispose of,
when he found the chance,&#8221; Sandy replied.</p>

<p>&#8220;And I suppose the old woodranger has
been talking again about the region of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
Mississippi,&#8221; remarked Bob, who could guess
what was on the mind of his brother.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; Sandy went on, &#8220;Abijah has seen
that wonderful country, and he knows how different
it is from this hilly place, where the
corn washes down the sides of the slopes whenever
a big rain comes. Out there it is mostly
prairie, and the soil, he says, is black and rich.
It will grow maize twice as high as your head.
The stories he tells of what he saw on those
prairies fairly make my heart ache.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But Sandy, you must try to forget all
that,&#8221; returned Bob, who often found it necessary
to restrain his impatient young brother.
&#8220;You are needed at home, for father is not
able to hunt and trap, besides taking care of
his crops. Nobody in the whole settlement
brings in as much game as you do. Wait a
few years, and then, when we are grown men,
perhaps we may strike out for that country
you have been hearing so much about; where
De Soto discovered the greatest of rivers, and
lies buried under its waters.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sandy sighed again.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose I must wait, just as you say,
Bob,&#8221; he observed, &#8220;but it may not be for
years, as you seem to think. Already some of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
the men are beginning to talk of making a
flatboat, and floating down the Ohio until they
reach the father of all the waters. They do
not like the idea of the rascally French taking
possession of all that fine land, which is a part
of our own Virginia. And it may not be so
very long before we will lose some of our people
in that way.&#8221; (<a id="Note_1r"></a><a href="#Note_1">Note 1.</a>)<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>These brave men, who had already successfully
braved the dangers that beset them on
their journey across the mountains to the Ohio
valley, had heard stories from the lips of trappers
who had penetrated far into the western
land in pursuit of the rich skins of otter,
beaver, fox, mink and marten. When their
crops failed to turn out as well as they had
anticipated, a spirit of unrest began to pervade
the little community; and these wonderful
tales were repeated, from lip to lip, always
with a longing to obtain a glimpse of the country
that offered such astonishing opportunities.</p>

<p>It was this spirit of unrest that peopled our
great West. Those who found themselves out-distanced
in the race, unwilling that others
should get ahead, gave up their holdings,
partly improved as they might be, and once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
more started out to get in the van of the procession
headed toward the setting sun.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think we will have any trouble getting
back to the other shore of the river, this
afternoon?&#8221; Sandy asked, after they had
walked along for a few minutes in silence,
headed for the first of their traps.</p>

<p>&#8220;I admit that I don&#8217;t just like the way we
were buffeted around on the voyage over,&#8221;
replied Bob; &#8220;and, if the waters keep on
rising to-night, as I think they are going to,
we will not be able to visit our traps on this
side for several days.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then had we better take them along with
us?&#8221; asked Sandy.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, they would bother us in the dugout,&#8221;
replied Bob; then, noticing the quick glance
his brother shot in his direction, he added:
&#8220;Yes, I am figuring on the chance of our boat
being upset in the flood; and, if that happened,
we&#8217;d have all we could do to save ourselves
and our guns, let alone half a dozen heavy
traps. They can stay here until we find a
chance to cross again, after the water goes
down.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, I wonder if Colonel Boone knew
about such a thing as a flood when he led us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
to where the settlement now stands?&#8221; remarked
Sandy, with a frown. &#8220;Because, if
the water rises very much more, we, as well
as some of the other settlers, stand to lose our
cabin. Already the water has covered the land
where open fields lay, ready to be planted in
maize this spring. All Mr. Bancroft&#8217;s new
fence has been taken down, to save it from
being swept away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I do not believe such a rise has been
known for many years,&#8221; Bob went on to say.
&#8220;You know how it flows between banks that
are covered with trees. These countless hills
are crowned with great forests, and under the
trees the ground is carpeted with moss and
dead leaves. This is like a great sponge,
father says, that soaks up the water during
rainy seasons, and lets it out again in time of
drought. I heard him say only this morning
that the Indians never knew of a flood like
this one. They believe that the Great Spirit
is angry because they have not driven the palefaces
from Kentucky. And there will be a
renewal of the fighting, after this rainy spell
is over, he fears.&#8221; (<a id="Note_2r"></a><a href="#Note_2">Note 2.</a>)</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, here&#8217;s where we set our first trap,&#8221;
Sandy cried. &#8220;And the next is only a short<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
distance along the trail. I&#8217;ll take a look at
this one, while you go on and attend to the
next.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is the best way, Sandy,&#8221; returned
Bob, with a quick glance toward the darkening
heavens. &#8220;I do not like the looks of those
clouds, and it may be that the rain will set in
again. If that happens, we would find it all
we could do to make a safe passage across the
river, for the darkness will fall early to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And we must not forget to keep our eyes
open for a sight of those rascally French trappers,
Jacques Larue and Henri Lacroix,&#8221; remarked
Sandy, with a suggestive movement of
his gun. &#8220;They have been reported as being
seen not far away from here of late, and you
know, Bob, they have never forgiven us the
way we managed to outwit Larue last fall, and
bring Henri Lacroix&#8217;s brother to justice.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>&#8220;But they also know,&#8221; Bob replied, &#8220;that
because you and I were able to do the great
Indian sachem, Pontiac, a favor, he gave us
his wampum belt, which has served to keep the
Indians who were on the war-path away from
our little settlement. Those Frenchmen understand
that, if either of us were hurt, the Indians<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
would visit vengeance on the head of
the guilty party. Larue learned that before
he escaped from the Indians.&#8221; (<a id="Note_3r"></a><a href="#Note_3">Note 3.</a>)</p>

<p>The boys had learned that Jacques Larue had
loosened his bonds and escaped from his Indian
captors through the connivance of a young
buck for whom he had once performed some
service, and was again free to work with Henri
Lacroix such damage against the latest English
settlers as their evil minds might suggest.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am convinced it was they who robbed
our traps several times this winter, so that
we had to change their location,&#8221; Sandy declared,
indignantly. &#8220;And, when that brush
was piled up against our cabin, that dark night,
and fired, did we not find tracks that were
never made by Indian feet? I seem to feel that
we have not seen the last of those French trappers.
And Pat O&#8217;Mara told me that, if ever
I had to shoot to defend myself against either
of them, to get the full value of my lead!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, let us hope that they will go elsewhere,
and do their trapping,&#8221; said Bob, as
he turned and left his brother. &#8220;I think it
is a great pity that, with a string of trading
posts all the way from the big lakes down to
the sea, these greedy French from the North<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
cannot let us alone here. They seem to want
the earth. But I&#8217;ll wait for you at the second
trap, Sandy. Be as quick as you can.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sandy made no reply, but hastened forward
to where they had set the first trap. He was
filled with thoughts of the stories he had heard
connected with the Mississippi country, and
he pictured in his mind the loveliest scene that
could ever greet the eager eyes of a pioneer&mdash;game
waiting to be shot and trapped; the
earth so rich that it would grow bountiful
crops upon being simply stirred; the fields
glorious with myriads of wild flowers; and
all to be had by simply reaching out a hand
and taking possession, in defiance of the
French, who claimed everything from the far
North to the gulf.</p>

<p>He found in the trap a fine red fox, which
he succeeded in knocking on the head without
injuring the pelt. Laying his gun aside, Sandy
started to reset the trap, believing that, as it
seemed to be a lucky place, perhaps the mate
of the fox might come along, and also step into
the steel circle.</p>

<p>As he began his task, an accident occurred
that had never happened to Sandy before in all
his trapping experience, and probably never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
would again. In some manner, which he could
not fully explain, in turning around to secure
something, he managed to thrust his foot into
the set trap, which he had quite forgotten.</p>

<p>There was a snap, and an acute feeling of
pain that caused the boy to give a startled cry.
His heavy leggings saved him to a great extent
from the cruel teeth of the trap, for at
that time the smooth jaws now in universal
use had not come into vogue; but the boy
knew he would have a sore ankle for some days
because of his carelessness.</p>

<p>Sandy tried to get at the trap to release himself,
and found that, because of the formation
of the ground at that particular spot, it would
prove a difficult task. He persisted in his efforts,
however, and refrained from calling out
to his brother, not wishing the more cautious
Bob to learn what a foolish thing he had done.</p>

<p>He was still striving to squirm around so
as to get at the double spring, and by pressure
release his foot, when he heard a sound close
by that riveted his attention. Looking up,
what was the boy&#8217;s dismay to discover a creeping
animal gradually drawing closer and closer
to him.</p>

<p>It needed only that one look to tell Sandy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
that he was being stalked by one of the most
dreaded animals of the forest, a gray panther,
that had evidently scented the blood of the captured
fox, and was bent on securing a supper.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 322px;">
<img src="images/i025.jpg" width="322" height="500" alt="moutain lion crouched watching Sandy" />
<div class="caption">&#8220;HE WAS BEING STALKED BY ONE OF THE MOST DREADED ANIMALS
OF THE FOREST, A GRAY PANTHER.&#8221;</div>
</div>

<p>Of course, Sandy&#8217;s first thought was of his
musket. He remembered placing this against
a neighboring tree, and, sure enough, it still
stood there; but, when he made a movement
to reach the weapon, he found to his dismay
that the chain of the fox trap was too short
to allow his fingers to come within a foot of
the gun!</p>

<p>In vain he writhed and pulled; the trap had
been made only too secure, and Sandy realized
that there was nothing he could do but lift up
his lusty young voice in an appeal for help.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II<br />

<small>THE BIRCH-BARK MESSAGE</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Bob Armstrong parted from his
brother he quickened his steps. The next trap
was not very far away; but, as he had just
said, he did not like the looks of the cloudy sky,
and began to fear that, after all, the break in
the heavy rainy spell was going to prove of
but short duration.</p>

<p>He knew that the little mother in that cabin
on the other side of the swollen water would
be worried about her boys, and Bob disliked
to give her any more reason for anxiety than
could be helped.</p>

<p>As he walked along he thought of what
Sandy had said about his determination,
sooner or later, to follow the river down past
Fort Washington, and far away to where it
united with the greatest of watercourses, the
mighty Mississippi. Bob, himself, was not so
indifferent to the beckoning finger of adventure
as his words to his brother might lead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
one to believe. He, too, had listened to those
marvelous stories told by trappers and traders,
and, when twice a flatboat had landed at
their rude little float, giving the settlers a
chance to talk with the bold souls who were
bent on risking the unknown dangers that lay
beyond, Bob had hung upon the adventurers&#8217;
words, and had longed to join the party as it
continued its voyage down the Ohio into the
unknown land. He had, however, always
thrust aside the thought, feeling that neither
he nor Sandy ought to think of leaving the
father, mother and sister Kate, who made up
the Armstrong household.</p>

<p>As he approached the spot where the trap
lay, Bob once more became the trapper, and
forgot all else. He saw that success had come
to them, for there was certainly some animal
in the trap.</p>

<p>It had been set in a certain little gully, where
the boys had discovered the tracks of several
mink, together with their holes. The tiny
stream that had trickled through this same
gully in the preceding fall, was now a rushing
torrent, and the trap had lately been set high
up on the bank, just in front of a particularly
inviting opening, where many tracks told of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
its being a favorite haunt for the wandering
males of the furry tribe he hunted.</p>

<p>Yes, it was a mink he had captured, and
really the largest and finest of the whole winter&#8217;s
catch. Bob felt pleased to make this
discovery, for every pelt which they could
gather meant more comforts in the Armstrong
home.</p>

<p>The mink seemed unusually fierce, and put
up a savage fight when Bob started to dispose
of him; but the young trapper would not be
denied, and he quickly put an end to the animal&#8217;s
sufferings.</p>

<p>As a usual thing the traps for mink and muskrats
were set in such fashion that, after being
caught, the animals would jump into the water,
and be drowned by the weight of the trap; so
that it was seldom they found one alive that
had to be disposed of in this manner.</p>

<p>Having reset the trap, Bob sat down to wait
for the coming of Sandy, and, while sitting
there, he drew something out of an inner
pocket of his hunting tunic, which he examined
with considerable interest, as well as with
many shakes of the head, that told of bewilderment.</p>

<p>The object was a soft and pliable piece of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
clean birch bark, upon the brown side of which
were traced several rude drawings, such as a
child might make. This had been done with
some sharp instrument, possibly the point of
a knife.</p>

<p>Bob Armstrong knew well that these crude
figures of men, campfires, streams and trails
were not intended to express the idle whim of
some white child, beginning to draw the things
he saw around him.</p>

<p>Bob had looked upon Indian picture-writing
before now; indeed, a young Shawanee brave,
named Blue Jacket, whose life he had once
saved, and whose friendship the brothers prized
very much, had shown them how to read these
symbols, by means of which the red men
communicated after their own fashion, just
as the palefaces did by putting all those
queer little signs in a line, and calling it writing.</p>

<p>This was the second time that Bob had found
a birch-bark letter left mysteriously at the
cabin. No one knew whence they came; but,
when the characters were deciphered, on each
occasion it was found that some one was warning
them against danger that hovered over
their heads.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>On the first occasion, they read that two
white men were hanging around near the settlement,
and meant to do the Armstrong family
harm. The careful mother&#8217;s first thought was
of Kate, her only daughter, a pretty girl, who
had already been once carried away by a young
chief of the Delawares, and rescued only after
much trouble by her brothers, assisted by
Simon Kenton and several of the young woodranger&#8217;s
comrades.</p>

<p>That very night there had come the alarm
of fire, with the greedy flames doing their best
to devour the cabin where David Armstrong
and his little brood lived. Only through the
most valiant labor was the fire conquered before
it could do much harm. And, now, Bob
had found a second strange warning under the
door of the cabin, on that very morning, he
being the first to arise.</p>

<p>He traced each symbol with his finger as he
sat there and mused. There were the same
two men again, whom he believed must stand
for the ugly French trappers, because they
wore hats, which no Indian ever was known
to do; and their feet &#8220;toed-out,&#8221; which was
another sure sign. In addition, he could make
out the cabins of the settlers, and the two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
bent figures appeared to be creeping toward
them.</p>

<p>Of course, word of the message had been
carried to all the other men in the community,
and doubtless there would be a strict watch
kept that coming night. If Jacques Larue and
his companion, Henri Lacroix, were discovered
approaching the settlement, other than erect
on their feet, the chances were that they would
be given a very warm reception.</p>

<p>But Bob was not puzzling his head just now
about what the symbols meant. He had had
little difficulty in understanding that some one
intended to warn them against the attacks of
their old-time enemies. The question that gave
both Bob and Sandy cause for speculation was
the identity of the friend from whom these two
birch-bark warnings came.</p>

<p>It was not Blue Jacket, Bob knew. He had
seen the young Shawanee brave draw similar
figures, and they were slightly different from
those now in front of him; even as one person&#8217;s
handwriting looks unlike that of another.
And yet Bob felt positive that the work must
have been done by an Indian.</p>

<p>The mystery piqued his curiosity greatly.
He and Sandy had tried to reason it out, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
discover the identity of this unknown and unseen
friend among the red men; but up to
now they had not met with any success.</p>

<p>After looking at the little strip of bark for
a minute, Bob shook his head, as though once
more compelled to abandon the solution of the
puzzle; and, allowing it to roll up again of
its own accord, he replaced the message in his
pocket.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d give a lot to know who sent those two
messages,&#8221; he muttered, as he started to take
the skin off the mink, not wishing to carry any
more burden than seemed necessary, if they
were to continue along the line of traps. &#8220;But,
anyway, it&#8217;s nice to feel that we&#8217;ve got a good
friend among the Indians, who takes delight in
upsetting the plans of those two precious rascals.
Some day he may see fit to make himself
known to us. But, I wonder what keeps Sandy.
He surely ought to be here by now, for he had
plenty of time to get to that trap, and fix it
fresh, if it was sprung. I hope nothing has
happened to him.&#8221;</p>

<p>He looked eagerly along the back trail, but
failed to see any sign of the approaching figure
of his younger brother. The afternoon was
more than three-quarters past, and in another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
hour they could expect darkness to swoop down
upon the land.</p>

<p>Bob noted this fact when he again looked up
toward the darkening heavens.</p>

<p>&#8220;We will have to leave the rest of the traps
until another day,&#8221; he said to himself, uneasily.
&#8220;I promised mother that I would not take
any more chances than necessary, and she did
not seem any too well satisfied about our crossing
to-day, as it was. But, how queer Sandy
does not come! Perhaps I&#8217;d better start back
after him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Once this idea had taken root in his mind,
Bob could not remain at ease. He arose to
his feet, took the mink in one hand, with his
rifle clutched in the other, and started off.</p>

<p>Hardly had he taken ten steps when he heard
a call. It was certainly his own name, and
coupled with a word that sent a thrill through
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bob! oh! Bob! Help!&#8221;</p>

<p>Instantly the boy dropped the mink, utterly
unmindful of the value of the fine pelt. He
started off at a swift pace, heading in the direction
whence the shout came.</p>

<p>If Sandy was in danger, then it must be some
of those hateful French trappers again. Bob<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
could remember how they had first met them,
and there were three at that time. A fine deer
had fallen before the gun of one of the brothers,
and, upon rushing forward to bleed the
prize, they found themselves confronted by a
trio of burly men whose appearance told the
lads that they were French trappers, even before
they proved this fact by their speech.</p>

<p>These fellows had claimed that they shot the
deer, and there was trouble in prospect that
might have ended seriously, but for the fortunate
coming of Kenton and two companions,
who proved the right of the boys to the spoils,
and sent the Frenchmen away, with a warning
not to look back or they would rue it.</p>

<p>Quickly Bob covered the ground. All the
while he had his gun ready for use in case of
necessity. Now he could see Sandy, and, when
he discovered the other on hands and knees,
great was his wonder, until he heard him cry
out:</p>

<p>&#8220;Take care, Bob, there&#8217;s a big panther in
the brush close by, and bent on jumping on
you! My foot&#8217;s fast in the trap, and I can&#8217;t
get free. Go slow, and be ready to shoot, for
he&#8217;s savage with hunger, and as fierce as they
make them. Look out! there he comes now!&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III<br />

<small>FROM ONE PERIL TO ANOTHER</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Bob</span> did not need the warning from Sandy
to put him on his guard. The mere fact that
there was a panther near by was sufficient reason
for his alertness, because no animal that
roamed the woods was more respected than
this sleek gray beast with the square jaws, the
powerful muscles and the sharp claws.</p>

<p>Every slight movement of the bushes caused
Bob to turn his eyes in that direction, with his
gun half raised, ready to take a quick shot.
And, yet, he knew well how important it was
that he use extreme care, when the time came
for firing. A wounded panther was a thing to
be dreaded by even the stoutest-hearted hunter.
He had heard many stories told around the
family hearth at home about these animals, by
such men as Pat O&#8217;Mara, the jolly Irish borderer,
old Reuben Jacks, the veteran hunter,
and others; all of whom agreed that they
would sooner face a bear, or a pack of wolves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
than a big &#8220;cat&#8221; that was wild with pain and
rage.</p>

<p>Bob could see his brother now, on his knees,
still struggling to release himself from the hold
of the fox trap, that seemed to grip his ankle
with a stubborn determination to keep him
from reaching his gun, standing there so close,
but beyond his itching fingers.</p>

<p>Once Bob thought he saw the beast crouching
among some bushes that ran down to the
edge of the water; but he dared not waste his
one shot on an uncertainty, since he would
then be compelled to defend himself with his
knife or hatchet. And, as it turned out, he
showed considerable wisdom in repressing his
boyish desire to fire, for just then there was
a movement in an entirely different direction,
and he had a glimpse of a gray beast slinking
past a small opening.</p>

<p>At this moment, Sandy made a new discovery
that added a new note of alarm to his voice:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! there are two of them, Bob! Be careful
what you do, brother! Try to scare them
off without shooting, if you can! Oh! if I
could only reach my gun, it would be all right;
but I&#8217;m held here, a prisoner!&#8221;</p>

<p>It was a time for doing the right thing, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
Bob well knew. If there were, indeed, a pair
of the animals, eager to pounce upon the boy
who was so helpless there, he would certainly
have his hands full.</p>

<p>Fire would frighten them away, Bob knew;
but he had no means of quickly igniting a
handful of dead leaves. In those early days,
long before matches of any kind had come to
be known, the only way to get fire was by the
use of flint and steel; and often it was a difficult
task, requiring a pinch of powder, the
same as was used for priming in the pan of
a gun.</p>

<p>In this emergency there flashed into the active
mind of the young pioneer a dozen schemes
for frightening the panthers away, or, at least,
make the brutes hesitate long enough for him
to have a chance to hand to his brother the
gun that was so tantalizingly close to his eager
fingers. Both armed, they might, by two well-directed
shots, put an end to both of the panthers.</p>

<p>Each scheme was, however, dismissed as
impracticable as soon as thought of, and there
remained to Bob only the one thought,&mdash;he
must, regardless of the danger, reach his brother&#8217;s
gun!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>Believing that a sudden noise might momentarily
disconcert the beasts, he gathered
himself for a spring, and then, with a shrill,
piercing cry, he leaped from the bushes, and
dashed forward.</p>

<p>The distance was but a few yards, and was
quickly covered. Seizing Sandy&#8217;s gun, he, by
the same motion, tossed it to his eager brother,
and the two lads, back to back, stood with
ready weapons, awaiting the spring of the
crouching panthers.</p>

<p>Moments passed and, to the boys, the tension
was fearful. Suddenly the silence was broken
by a sharp, cracking sound, followed by a
mighty crash, as a huge dead tree toppled
down, its bare, gaunt branches grazing the
boys, as they stood alertly eying the surrounding
bushes.</p>

<p>This was followed by a slight rustling sound
and then all was again still.</p>

<p>For several minutes the lads maintained their
tense attitude and then, with a sigh of relief,
Bob relaxed his strained muscles.</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe, Sandy, the fall of that dead tree
scared the brutes away,&#8221; he said, at last.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are right, Bob,&#8221; answered the other,
with a ring of disgust in his voice; &#8220;I do believe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
the cowards are slinking off over there,
for I saw the brush moving. I wish we could
have had a shot at them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, for one, I&#8217;m glad they&#8217;ve taken a
notion to let us alone,&#8221; Bob remarked. &#8220;I was
afraid that they would spring at any second,
and we might have missed, or only wounded,
one or both of the panthers. It was exciting
while it lasted, Sandy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I can say it was,&#8221; replied the other,
with a shrug of his shoulders. &#8220;Just think
of me held up here like this, and with the teeth
of that old trap biting in deeper every time I
pulled, or tried to turn around. Please get
me loose, Bob; my ankle will be pretty sore
after this, I&#8217;m afraid.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So you couldn&#8217;t turn around to unfasten
it yourself,&#8221; remarked the other, as he hastened
to turn the trap over, so that he might
stand on the double spring, and thus throw
back the two jaws. &#8220;There, does that fix it,
Sandy? Looks like those teeth had chewed
pretty well into your buckskin legging, too. I
hope you won&#8217;t be crippled too badly to limp
back to the boat.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sandy scrambled to his feet, and started to
try his left leg. He certainly did limp considerably,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
but only made a wry face as he
said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll have to stand it, Bob. And, then, it
might have been so much worse. Think how
those sharp teeth must have cut into my leg
but for the support of that stout deerskin legging.
And even they would have been nothing
like the teeth of a panther. I honestly believe
the savage beasts meant to get me. And, after
this, I&#8217;m just going to add as many panther
skins to our bag as I can, to pay up for the
scare they gave me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; Bob replied, &#8220;I think we&#8217;ll give
up all idea of keeping along our line of traps
to-day. Not to speak of your lame ankle, it
seems to get darker all the while; and, with
the river before us, we&#8217;d be foolish to stay over
here any longer than we can help. You remember
what mother told us, Sandy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! I wouldn&#8217;t bother my head about any
trouble we might have in making the other
shore all right,&#8221; declared the confident younger
boy; &#8220;but, then, with this pain in my leg, I
don&#8217;t see how I could manage to get over much
ground. However, if you care to go on alone,
I can get back to the boat, and wait there for
you to come.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>Bob shook his head resolutely.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll return with you, Sandy,&#8221; he said,
&#8220;but first we will pick up the mink I dropped,
if, indeed, those hungry woods cats have not
already found it. It looks as if we will have
to be contented with a fox and a mink for this
afternoon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;With three more traps to hear from,&#8221;
grumbled Sandy, who hated exceedingly to be
kept from doing what he had planned. &#8220;This
seemed to be our lucky day, Bob; and the
chances are we&#8217;d have found something in
every trap. Now those two panthers will just
about run the line, and clean everything out
for us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Still, we have a whole lot to be thankful
for,&#8221; urged the older boy, as he picked up the
red fox, threw it over his shoulder, and offered
to assist Sandy in walking. The other, however,
scorned to appear like a cripple, and
managed unaided to limp along close at his
brother&#8217;s heels, though he made many a wry
face, unseen by Bob, as pains shot through the
injured ankle.</p>

<p>They were fortunate enough to find the mink
just where it had been so hastily dropped when
Bob heard the shouts of the trapped boy, and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
as soon as this had been secured, they turned
their faces toward the point where the dugout
had been left.</p>

<p>&#8220;You see that I was right about the weather
thickening up again,&#8221; Bob remarked, leading
the way at as fast a pace as he believed the
lame member of the expedition could stand.</p>

<p>&#8220;It does grow gloomy right along, for a fact.
As you say, Bob, perhaps the bad spell was
only broken for a short time, and the rains
may come on worse than ever. Ouch! that
hurt like everything then. I didn&#8217;t see that
root sticking up in the trail. Don&#8217;t I wish I
was over home right now, so I could wash that
sore spot with hot water, and have mother
apply some of that wonderful salve which she
makes out of herbs.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Only a little way more, and we&#8217;ll strike the
boat,&#8221; called out Bob, encouragingly; &#8220;there,
I can see the place now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was just thinking what a fix we&#8217;d be in
if we found it gone!&#8221; remarked Sandy.
&#8220;With the river booming bank-full, and the
current as fierce as a wolf pack, how in the
wide world would we ever manage to get
across, Bob?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not going to bother my head trying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
to guess,&#8221; answered the other. &#8220;Time enough
to cross a bridge when you come to it. Besides,
I happen to know that the boat is still there,
for I just had a glimpse of it. But, did you
mean you thought the river could have risen
enough, since we left, to carry it off?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Sandy, soberly, &#8220;I was thinking
of that second warning you found under
the door of the cabin this very morning, and
wondering whether those French trappers
could be around on this side of the river. If
they saw our boat, and guessed whose it was,
they&#8217;d be ready to send it adrift, and keep us
from getting home to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is just what I think, myself; and
they would do even worse than that, if they
had the chance. The only thing that keeps
them from firing on us as we pass through the
forest is their fear of the vengeance of Boone
and Kenton, not to speak of Pontiac, whose
wampum belt hangs in our cabin, a sign of his
protecting hand over the Armstrong family.
But, here we are; and now to get started right
away.&#8221;</p>

<p>One glance out upon the heaving bosom of
the flood told Sandy that they had been wise
to give up further idea of staying on the further<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
shore. Indeed, with the gathering darkness,
it began to look as if, even now, they had
taken more chances than were wise or prudent.</p>

<p>The boys pushed out with a fearlessness that
was characteristic of their actions. Accustomed
to facing perils by land or water, they
seldom hesitated, or allowed anything like
alarm to influence them, when duty called.
And both lads knew that, should they fail to
return home on that night, there would be little
sleep under the Armstrong roof.</p>

<p>As usual, Sandy sat in the bow of the boat,
while his brother managed the stern paddle
with considerable dexterity. Until they had
come to the Ohio country neither boy had had
very much experience in boats; but, after the
dugout was built, they spent much of their
time on the water, shooting ducks for the family
larder, fishing, or crossing over to hunt on
the other shore, where, later on in the fall, they
had stretched a line of traps that brought them
in many a fine pelt.</p>

<p>They soon found that, somehow, owing to
the trend of the shore, perhaps, it was going
to prove an even more difficult task to push
the heavy dugout back to the southern side of
the river, than it had been in coming across.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
The current added to their troubles, for it carried
them along faster than either of the boys
had dreamed possible. For the first time, possibly,
they were learning of the power of the
flood, once it arose in its tremendous might.</p>

<p>Both lads strained every muscle as they
drove the blades deeply into the water. They
had, by the hardest kind of work, managed to
get about half-way over, though both of them
were somewhat winded by their efforts, when
they noticed that heavy clouds, rolling up
across the heavens, had begun to bring the dusk
of night much earlier than even the careful
Bob had anticipated.</p>

<p>There were many obstructions that had to
be avoided. Trees were floating on the surface
of the water in places, and logs seemed plentiful.
Altogether, it was an entirely new sight
to both Bob and his brother, for, until now,
they had never known the beautiful Ohio to
rise to a point that could be called dangerous.</p>

<p>&#8220;Take care, and keep away from that
tree!&#8221; warned Bob, as he saw a particularly
ugly snag, with broken branches sticking out
along its sides, bearing down upon them on
the left.</p>

<p>They had to paddle furiously in order to keep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
clear of this threatening object, and, possibly,
in his eagerness, Sandy may have bent too
heavily on his paddle, for, just as they reached
a point where they would be safe from the floating
tree, there was a sharp snap.</p>

<p>&#8220;What happened?&#8221; cried Bob, alarmed
more than he would have liked to confess.</p>

<p>For reply Sandy held up the stump of his
paddle. It had broken off clean, and, from
that time on, only one could paddle at a time.
This catastrophe was sure to delay their passage,
and doubtless cause them to be swept
some miles down-stream before they could
land; but the boys were hardy, and would not
mind walking back, though doubtless Sandy
might complain a little on account of his lame
leg.</p>

<p>Bob set to work again with a good will, and
was making fair progress when yet another
peril came booming along, this time in the
shape of a heavy log that was sweeping with
the speeding current.</p>

<p>Bob saw the danger and strove the best he
could to avoid it; but, in the clutch of the current,
the little dugout seemed but a plaything,
and the log, driving three times as fast as they
were going, bore straight down upon them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
When Bob saw that a collision was unavoidable,
he called at the top of his voice to his
brother:</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s going to strike us, Sandy. Hold on
to your gun if you can, and climb aboard the
log as they come together; for I fear that the
boat will sink. Quick! jump now!&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV<br />

<small>AT THE MERCY OF THE FLOOD</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">In</span> that moment of alarm Sandy forgot all
about his lame ankle. He realized, as soon as
the crash came, that the dugout was about to
sink, for water began to pour in over the side.
So he obeyed the cry of his brother, and made
a spring for the safety of the log that had done
the damage.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 322px;">
<img src="images/i049.jpg" width="322" height="500" alt="paddling crashing canoe against tree" />
<div class="caption">&#8220;MADE A SPRING FOR THE SAFETY OF THE LOG THAT HAD DONE
THE DAMAGE.&#8221;</div>
</div>

<p>How he managed to scramble on it he could
never afterwards explain; but, when he had
done so, and looked around, it was to discover
Bob sitting astride the rolling log, close by,
and the half-sunken boat just vanishing from
sight in the gathering gloom.</p>

<p>&#8220;How is it, Sandy; are you all right?&#8221;
anxiously asked Bob.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m on the log, if that is what you mean,&#8221;
gasped the younger boy, noticing, however,
that their strange craft began to roll less, now
that they had settled down upon its broad back.</p>

<p>&#8220;And I hope you held on to your gun?&#8221;
Bob went on; for even in that terrible moment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
he could remember such a thing. This was
hardly to be wondered at, because it had taken
both of the boys many a long month&#8217;s work
with their first traps, away off in Virginia, to
gather together enough money to purchase the
flint-lock muskets they owned, and which had
always served their purpose well. To lose one
meant another expenditure of hard-earned
shillings, and even pounds.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have it here, safe and sound,&#8221; replied
Sandy, not without a touch of pride in his
voice; for to have managed to get aboard that
rolling log in such a hurry, and to keep a grasp
upon the long musket, was no trifling task.</p>

<p>&#8220;That was a close shave,&#8221; said the elder
brother, with a long-drawn sigh; since he had
been terribly alarmed for the moment, more
on account of Sandy than for himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;We never had a more exciting time,&#8221; admitted
his brother, frankly.</p>

<p>&#8220;And we have much to be thankful for,&#8221;
continued Bob.</p>

<p>&#8220;For this old floating log, you mean?&#8221; observed
Sandy, not without a touch of sarcasm
in his voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, because even an old log may turn out
to be a pretty good friend,&#8221; Bob went on,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
positively. &#8220;I&#8217;ve heard father declare that a
sailor is thankful for any port in a storm; and,
only for this log, we might have been swimming
our level best right now, brother, to keep
our heads above water.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That may be,&#8221; answered Sandy, still unconvinced;
&#8220;but you forget that, only for this
same log, we would have been safe and sound
in our dugout, and paddling as nice as anything
for the bank. As it is, we&#8217;ve lost our boat,
paddle and all, as well as the fox and mink;
and will have to borrow Alexander Hodgson&#8217;s
craft until we can build another.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let us shout as loud as we can,&#8221; proposed
Bob. &#8220;Perhaps some of the settlers will hear
us, if they are down near the edge of the river,
watching how fast it keeps on rising.&#8221;</p>

<p>Accordingly both lads sent out sturdy calls
at the top of their voices; but there came back
no answering, reassuring shout. Only the murmur
of the flood could be heard, or it might be
a grinding noise as the log came in contact with
other floating stuff.</p>

<p>So finally the boys, as if by mutual consent,
gave up hallooing.</p>

<p>For a little time they sat there in silence,
both looking uneasily toward the shore which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
marked the connecting link between themselves
and their home, though it could only be faintly
seen, where the tree-crowned hills stood out
against the dull, darkening heavens.</p>

<p>Bob suddenly aroused himself. This was no
time for vain regrets. They must be up and
doing, if they hoped to cope with the new and
strange situation into which a freak of fortune
had so suddenly thrust them.</p>

<p>&#8220;We must try to do something to get ashore,
Sandy,&#8221; he said, firmly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was just thinking that way, myself,&#8221; admitted
the other; &#8220;but, since we have no paddles,
and this log chooses to remain out here
in the middle of the river, I&#8217;m bothered to know
how it can be done.&#8221;</p>

<p>As usual, Sandy was depending part upon
his brother to suggest some way out of their
difficulty; not that he did not possess a bright
mind himself, but when it came to quick thinking,
and the suggesting of a reasonable plan,
Bob was always to be relied on.</p>

<p>&#8220;Paddles would do us little good just now,
I fear,&#8221; said Bob. &#8220;We are both of us good
swimmers, and might be able to make the
shore; but the water is very cold, and there
would be danger of a cramp catching one of us.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
For that reason I don&#8217;t like the idea of deserting
this friendly log. We are at least safe as
long as we have it to cling to.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, Bob, what if we keep on floating all
night? We will be chilled to the marrow with
this cold wind, and the rain that promises to
fall. Besides, when the dawn breaks, we will
find ourselves many miles down the river. And
what would mother think?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ve got a plan in my mind that
might help us,&#8221; the other went on. &#8220;We don&#8217;t
want to lose our guns, to begin with; and, once
we took to the water in that way, how could we
hold on to them? So here&#8217;s what I was thinking.
Let us fasten the guns, and our clothes,
as far as we can, to this log. I always carry
some buckskin thongs in the pocket of my tunic,
and there are knobs here and there, where
branches have been broken off.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sandy broke out laughing.</p>

<p>&#8220;But, what good would that do us?&#8221; he
demanded. &#8220;If ever we did get ashore, think
how cold we should be, and likely to starve to
death. I think I&#8217;d rather take my chances sitting
right here, than try that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you don&#8217;t understand the whole of the
plan yet, Sandy,&#8221; the other went on, steadily,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
for he was quite used to having his impatient
brother break in upon him in this way.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! if there is more of it, I&#8217;m glad to hear
it,&#8221; Sandy remarked. &#8220;After we&#8217;ve tied our
guns, and part of our clothes, to the log, what
do we expect to do then, Bob&mdash;fly away to
the shore away over yonder? We might,&mdash;if
only we had wings!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Listen, then,&#8221; Bob pursued. &#8220;We&#8217;ll slip
down into the water, and, one on either side
of the log, start steering it in the direction of
land. Do you understand now, brother?&#8221;</p>

<p>Sandy gave a shout, for he was always enthusiastic,
once he discovered any reason for
being so.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is a great idea, Bob,&#8221; he said, warmly.
&#8220;And I never would have thought it out in
an hour. Just as you say, we can, by slow
stages, push the log ashore. Even if it is miles
below the settlement, we will have our clothes
with us, and tinder bags to start a fire with.
But why, do you think, did no one answer our
shouts back there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In the first place,&#8221; replied Bob, who was
beginning to fumble around, in a hunt for the
best nubbin of a broken branch, to which he
might secure his valuables, consisting of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
precious musket, powder horn, bullet pouch,
tinder bag, and last, if not least of all, his
clothes, which the loving fingers of their mother
had fashioned out of pliable deerskin; &#8220;in the
first place, we must have been some distance
below the settlement at the time of our accident.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; added Sandy, at once, seeing how
reasonable this sounded, &#8220;I think you are
right about that, Bob.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And,&#8221; continued the other, &#8220;even if they
had guessed that the cries came from down the
river, what could they have done to help us?
There is no better boat than the one we owned;
and, with night at hand, and the sky as black
as it is now, the women would not have let the
men venture out upon the water. They are
always in mortal fear lest the wily Indians lay
some plan for the undoing of our settlement,
and begin with luring some of its defenders
away.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sandy, too, was beginning to secure some of
his things to the novel craft which a strange
decree of fate had made them accept as a means
of riding the flood in safety. When he had
received the several buckskin thongs which his
brother passed over to him, the task of securing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
the gun to the two knobs he had selected
was first of all begun, because with that in his
hands he could accomplish little.</p>

<p>But Sandy, dearly loved to talk. It was indeed
hard to keep him quiet, for he was always
either seeking information from another, or
else desirous of imparting his own views upon
various subjects.</p>

<p>So, even as he worked, he must needs start
afresh.</p>

<p>&#8220;How far do you believe we will be from
home when we get to land?&#8221; was what he first
of all asked his brother, just as though the
other was a knowledge box upon which he could
draw at will.</p>

<p>&#8220;That would be hard to say,&#8221; replied Bob.
&#8220;It all depends on how long we are in landing.
This flood must be going anywhere from six
to seven miles an hour; and, even if we are
lucky, we would find ourselves perhaps ten
miles below our home.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That would be further than we have ever
wandered down the river,&#8221; remarked Sandy,
for their trapping and hunting had all been
done within the immediate vicinity of the settlement,
since game could often be found inside
of ten minutes&#8217; walk.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>Once only had the brothers been tempted to
take a long journey. This was when their sister
Kate, at a time when their father had gone
in Virginia on urgent business, had been carried
off by a young chief of the Delawares;
and a pursuit was undertaken by the brothers
that led them to the far distant great lakes.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>&#8220;Well, if we can make the bank in safety,
I, for one, will not complain of the distance,&#8221;
declared Bob. &#8220;How is your gun fixed now;
are you sure that it will hold safe, even if we
should knock up against another log?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, it is fast to the tree trunk, and can
never slip loose,&#8221; returned Sandy. &#8220;The
more I think of this plan of yours, the better
I like it, Bob. Once we are in the water, and
swimming, we can urge the log toward the
shore, a foot at a time, it may be, but with a
constant pressure, until at last we find that we
can touch bottom. Then for a fire, and warming
up, for I fear by that time both of us will
be chilled to the bone.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And if your lame ankle is so bad that it
prevents our getting back to-night, why, Sandy,
what should hinder us from making camp in
the forest, under some ledge, where we can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
keep out of the rain? Then, when morning
comes, we can follow up the river until we reach
our home again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It makes me feel better to hear you talk
like that, Bob,&#8221; declared the younger of the
two. &#8220;I wonder what I would have done without
you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps just what we mean to do right
now,&#8221; Bob went on to say. &#8220;The trouble is,
Sandy, you will not think for yourself, when you
have me to depend on. You must remember
what father told you once, that every tub ought
to stand on its own bottom. But Simon Kenton
tells me he was just such a youngster, until he
found himself thrown on his own resources.
It was the making of him, he declares; because
such things are apt to bring out all there is in
a boy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Both of them were still diligently working
to secure their possessions safely to the
friendly trunk, which, having been the means
of their disaster, now seemed willing to make
reparation as best it could by offering them
an asylum for those things which otherwise
must have gone into the river with them.</p>

<p>It had, by now, grown so dark that all they
could see was a stretch of about thirty feet or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
so of surging water on either side of them.
Ahead, a similar unending panorama opened
up, and, had they chosen to turn their heads
in order to cast a backward glance, they would
have looked upon the same dismal spectacle.</p>

<p>&#8220;There,&#8221; said Sandy at last, &#8220;that job is
done, and I&#8217;m ready to pull off my tunic, hunting
shirt, and coonskin cap, which I&#8217;ll make up
into a bundle, and fasten with this last long
thong. But, Bob, before we do that, and go
overboard, it seems to me we ought to give a
last shout for help. There is about one chance
in a thousand that some person in a boat may
hear us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll take that chance, then, Sandy,&#8221;
echoed Bob. &#8220;So, ready now, and shout when
I do, with all your might!&#8221;</p>

<p>Again did their lusty young voices ring out
over the flood. Once, twice, thrice they gave
tongue, and then, pausing, listened to see if by
chance there came any welcome reply. Immediately
Sandy gave a low bubbling cry of satisfaction.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you hear that?&#8221; he demanded.
&#8220;Some one certainly answered us; unless it
was an echo from the hills away off yonder.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was no echo, Sandy,&#8221; replied Bob.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
&#8220;Shout again, and louder than before. There
is hope of a rescue even now. That one chance
looks better! Now, let go!&#8221;</p>

<p>This time the answering hail seemed somewhat
closer, as though they were sweeping
down toward the spot where the unknown must
be sitting in his boat, holding it to some degree
against the rushing current.</p>

<p>Sandy became wild with excitement. He had
almost despaired of assistance coming to them
before, and, now that this sudden chance
loomed up, the horizon seemed to brighten visibly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! I can hear the sound of paddles,
Bob!&#8221; he exclaimed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, that is what I was just listening to,&#8221;
answered the other, and Sandy was surprised
to note a lack of the same enthusiasm about
Bob that reigned in his own heart.</p>

<p>&#8220;What ails you?&#8221; he demanded. &#8220;We are
in a fair way of being taken safely ashore, and
yet you do not seem to be happy. Is there anything
wrong, do you think, about that answer
to our shouts? Surely it could not be an echo,
for by now we can make out the dip of paddles
plainly. Tell me what worries you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is just it,&#8221; replied Bob, soberly;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
&#8220;the dip of the paddles, as you say, which tells
us that others are on the flood as well as ourselves.
But I have never heard a white man
handle a paddle just like that, and there are
many who have tried it all their lives.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sandy asked no more questions. Doubtless,
if his face could have been seen just then, it
would be found to have taken on a sudden pallor,
as he muttered to himself the one significant
word:</p>

<p>&#8220;Indians!&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V<br />

<small>FRIENDS IN TIME OF NEED</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">There</span> was really nothing that could be done.</p>

<p>In a choice between two evils, Bob Armstrong
could always be depended on to take
that which seemed the less. To go on down
the flood was a dreadful outlook; and almost
anything was to be preferred to facing the
unknown perils of the river, especially in the
pitch darkness that prevailed.</p>

<p>The sound of the paddles drew constantly
nearer. Then they heard voices, as if those in
the canoe were asking each other whence it
could be that they had heard that last shout
for help.</p>

<p>To the astonishment of the floating boys the
words came in English, though evidently one
of the speakers was an Indian who had apparently
learned the tongue of the palefaces.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! it&#8217;s Pat O&#8217;Mara, I do believe!&#8221; exclaimed
Sandy, in his amazement speaking loud
enough for his voice to carry some distance
away; for immediately, even before Bob could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
add any words of his own to the declaration,
there came a hail out of the gloom.</p>

<p>&#8220;Avast there! Be ye the Arrmstrong byes
I&#8217;m afther hearin&#8217; out on this roarin&#8217;, tearin&#8217;
flood this night?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, yes, that&#8217;s who it is, Pat; and precious
glad to hear the sound of your voice,
because we need help the worst way!&#8221; cried
Sandy, always impulsive.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, we&#8217;ll be wid yees in a jiffy, depind
on it,&#8221; came the answer from a point
close at hand. &#8220;Give us another few digs at
the paddle, chief, an&#8217;, by the same token, we&#8217;ll
soon be alongside, so we will.&#8221;</p>

<p>A minute later the anxious boys began to
detect some moving object, as they strained
their eyes to see. Then this turned out to be
a long canoe, in which two persons were sitting,
the one in the stern using a paddle with that
grace and dexterity which only an Indian could
exhibit, just as Bob had wisely said.</p>

<p>Sandy craned his head forward to see better
through the darkness. Doubtless there must
have been something familiar about the movements
of this paddler, for he certainly did not
have enough light to recognize his features, or
even the feather that adorned his scalplock.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;Surely that must be Blue Jacket!&#8221; he
ejaculated, with a thrill of delight, as well as
surprise noticeable in his quivering voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Uh! that so, Sandy,&#8221; came in a voice he
knew almost as well as he did that of his
brother.</p>

<p>&#8220;What luck!&#8221; cried Sandy. &#8220;To think
that such good friends should happen to be on
the river this night of all times, when we are
in such sore need.&#8221;</p>

<p>Perhaps, had Bob Armstrong been asked his
opinion, he might have declared that it was
something much higher than mere luck that
brought about such a happy conclusion to their
adventure. Bob was a much more serious fellow
than his younger brother, and imbibed
some of the sentiments that influenced his
gentle mother. To him there was something
especially Providential in this coming of help
when the two boys were in so great need, just
as there had been in the falling of the dead tree
just as the panthers were about to attack
them.</p>

<p>Quickly the canoe worked up alongside the
log, to which both the Irish trapper and his
native companion fastened a firm grip.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come aboord, and be sinsible,&#8221; said Pat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
O&#8217;Mara, who was one of the oldest friends
the Armstrong family had; and whom they had
known away back in Old Virginia, before the
thought of daring the perils of the unknown
wilderness had ever entered David Armstrong&#8217;s
mind. &#8220;Sure, &#8217;tis a mighty poor sort av a
craft ye do be havin&#8217;, if I might make so
bowld.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But it was better than nothing,&#8221; said
Sandy, as he carefully placed his musket in the
canoe before even thinking of attempting to
get aboard himself.</p>

<p>Bob did not make a single move until he had
seen his brother safely over the side. Indeed,
to judge from his actions, one might be inclined
to think that he even kept himself in
readiness to clutch Sandy, should the other
manage to slide down the side of the log into
the water, instead of gaining a lodgment in
the boat. Then Bob copied the other&#8217;s actions,
his precious gun being first made secure before
he would think of himself.</p>

<p>It was rather a ticklish business leaving the
log, and entering the canoe that, being made
of birch bark, was so light in build that it careened
under the passage of the boys, and
might have tipped over had not both Pat and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
the young Shawanee brave leaned far to the
opposite side while the embarkation was taking
place.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-bye, old log!&#8221; said Sandy, now in
an exultant frame of mind that contrasted
strangely with his recent gloomy spirits. &#8220;We
hope you will have a good voyage down to the
great Mississippi. Tell them that, perchance,
the Armstrong boys will be navigating that way
to see some of the wonders they have so long
been hearing about. You were a pretty fair
kind of a log, though we are not sorry to part
with you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Already was the paddle, in the expert hands
of Blue Jacket, busily employed in sending the
craft toward the southern shore of the swollen
river. Pat O&#8217;Mara had his share of curiosity,
and he was not the one to keep silent when
desirous of knowing the true facts.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure, &#8217;tis a quare thing to be findin&#8217; the
two av yees adrift on a tree out on this high
water,&#8221; he started to say; &#8220;and, by the same
token, if yees have no objection, &#8217;tis mesilf wud
like to know how the same came about.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is easy enough to tell, Pat,&#8221; burst
out Sandy. &#8220;Of course, you mustn&#8217;t think we
started from the shore, to cross over on an old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
log. It was just an accident, and that&#8217;s all.
My paddle broke under the strain; and, when
this log came whirling down on our boat, Bob
alone could not get it out of the way. So it
was upset, and we were lucky enough to scramble
aboard, guns and all.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Irish trapper was loud in his exclamations
of wonder.</p>

<p>&#8220;It do bate iverything how ye two lads
always manage to chate the ould Reaper whin
he thinks he has ye in the hollow av his hand,&#8221;
he declared. &#8220;I warrant ye that nine out av
tin min would have at laste taken a dip in the
water afore crawling aboord the log; and, be
the powers, ye do not same to be wit at all, at
all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We were wondering how we could manage
to get ashore, so as to head for home,&#8221; Sandy
went on to say, &#8220;when Bob thought of a way.
Just when we heard your answer to our last
shout we were about to fasten our guns and
clothing to the log, slip overboard, and, by
swimming, push it toward the shore.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A cliver ijee, by me troth,&#8221; remarked Pat,
who was a great admirer of both young pioneers;
of Bob on account of his steady ways
and quick mind in emergencies, and of Sandy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
because he had a winning, sunny disposition,
which appealed especially to the genial, roving
Irish trapper. &#8220;But, afther all, &#8217;tis just as
will that Blue Jacket and mesilf came upon the
sane at the time we did, since &#8217;tis a wet back
ye&#8217;d be havin&#8217;, not to spake of many miles more
to thramp back home. And &#8217;tis also will that
ye are off the river before this same night is
many hours older.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bob noticed that there was a peculiar significance
to these last words of their old friend,
who had been many times tried, and found as
true as steel.</p>

<p>&#8220;What brings you and Blue Jacket here,
and on your way to our cabin, as I reckon you
are from the way you head across the river?&#8221;
he asked, desirous of drawing the other out,
and learning what new peril now threatened
the little settlement on the southern bank of
the Ohio.</p>

<p>More than once had Pat brought news of the
coming of Indians on the warpath, so that the
pioneers had learned to look upon him as their
best guardian. As he was forever roaming the
great forests, sometimes in the company of
such noted men as Daniel Boone, Simon Kenton
or Harrod the surveyor, Pat was in a position<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
to pick up intelligence that could be obtained
by no one else. (<a id="Note_4r"></a><a href="#Note_4">Note 4.</a>)</p>

<p>And so Bob wondered whether it could be
something of this character that was now causing
him to hasten to the relief of the struggling
settlement.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure, &#8217;twas by sheer accident that we came
togither,&#8221; the trapper observed, as he bent his
supple body quickly to one side, so as to better
balance the frail canoe, which at that instant
was being buffeted about in a swirl of waters,
not unlike a miniature whirlpool. &#8220;An&#8217;, whin
I larned that the chief was aven thin on his way
to warrn the white settlers as fast as he could
go, I made up me mind to accompany him.
So that&#8217;s how it happens we wor abroad on the
river jist at the same time ye naded hilp so bad.
Troth, as Sandy jist said, &#8217;twas a lucky thing
all around.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, Pat,&#8221; Bob continued, &#8220;of what danger
was Blue Jacket about to warn our people?
Have the Indians again taken to the warpath,
after their professions of peace, and after
saying that the hatchet was buried ever so
deep?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure, there be always danger av that
same,&#8221; remarked the other, grimly; &#8220;but, on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
this occasion, &#8217;tis a peril av another color intirely.
The flood is bearin&#8217; down upon yees
like a race horse, and, befoor the dawn av another
day, it may be the risin&#8217; water wull be
afther swapin&#8217; away some av the cabins in the
settlement!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! but how could Blue Jacket learn about
that, when it must be many miles up the river,
and coming much faster than any Indian could
run?&#8221; demanded Sandy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ye must know,&#8221; went on the Irish trapper,
impressively, &#8220;that these rid hathen have
a way av communicatin&#8217; news by manes av
smoke signals in the day time, and fires at night.
From hill to hill, many miles away, they sind
these smokes; and, so I&#8217;ve been towld at laist,
the missage can be carried as much as a hundred
miles in less time than it wud take a horse
to run tin.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, that is something I knew about, but
had forgotten,&#8221; admitted Sandy.</p>

<p>&#8220;And this flood, does it come from the last
rain, or has there been what I heard my father
call a cloud-burst?&#8221; asked Bob, anxiously; for
his thoughts were upon the little community
some miles up the river, which had already
grappled with more perils than the settlers had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
ever dreamed could be met with in this new
country.</p>

<p>&#8220;That I do not chanct to know, me bye,&#8221;
replied Pat. &#8220;&#8217;Tis enough to learn that the
flood is comin&#8217; tearin&#8217; along down the river,
and that the water will rise in a way niver
known before. The Injuns are wild with
alarrm. Their ould medicine-min do be on the
rampage, and kape tillin&#8217; thim they do be sufferin&#8217;
from the anger av the Great Spirit,
becase av their allowin&#8217; the white trispassers
till remain on the sacred land that was given
till their ancestors long years ago. It all manes
hapes av trouble for the pioneers, from Boonesborough
till Fort Washington, and all the way
along the Ohio.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can see the shore again,&#8221; called out
Sandy at this moment; for, while he had been
listening with deep anxiety to what the trapper
said, at the same time his keen young eyes had
been on the watch to detect the first signs of
land ahead.</p>

<p>A minute later, and Sandy again broke out
with an exclamation, and this time there was
a note of wonder, not unmixed with anxiety, in
his voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look! there is a fire burning on the shore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
below, and just about where we will come to
the land!&#8221; he cried out.</p>

<p>&#8220;And I can see one or two white men beside
it; yes, with an Indian also,&#8221; added Bob, who
had as sharp vision as his brother.</p>

<p>&#8220;And they must hear us talking, for they
have jumped to their feet, and seem to be looking
this way. Can it be some of our friends
from above, brother?&#8221; asked the younger boy,
eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not think so,&#8221; Bob answered. &#8220;They
are not in the broad firelight now; but, from
the glimpse I had, I took them to be woodrangers
like Pat here, and some of the others
we know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! perhaps, then, it may be Boone and
Kenton themselves,&#8221; remarked Sandy, who had
secretly always admired the forest ranger,
Kenton, and aspired to follow in the footsteps
of the daring young man, when he grew
older.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, we shall soon know,&#8221; Bob went on,
&#8220;for Blue Jacket is heading straight in to that
point where they have built their fire, as though
he means to land on the lower side, where the
current does not run so fiercely.&#8221;</p>

<p>Already they were in less turbulent waters,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
for, near the shore, the river did not attain
anything like the swiftness that marked the
middle of the stream. Under the skillful guidance
of the sturdy young Shawanee brave,
whose name, although not very well known just
then, was fated later on to be on the lips of
every settler who had built a cabin in the wilderness
along the Ohio, the canoe presently
came against the shore.</p>

<p>Sandy, as usual, was the first to jump on to
the bank; but he was careful to take his gun
along with him. The Irish trapper quickly
reached his side, and then came Bob, and the
dusky Blue Jacket, who certainly could never
be accused of being a talkative fellow, though
capable of expressing himself freely on occasion.</p>

<p>As if instinctively they allowed the young
Shawanee to lead the way toward the burning
campfire, because the presence of an Indian
would seem to indicate that he might be better
able to conduct the intercourse with the strangers;
for already Bob and Sandy had discovered
that the two white men were totally unknown
to them. Besides, since it was Blue
Jacket&#8217;s canoe, he seemed to be conducting the
expedition to the settlement, the others having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
just been taken on as he happened to come
across them.</p>

<p>But Bob Armstrong felt a new uneasiness
creep over him when he heard the Irish trapper
mutter something half under his breath, and
caught the one significant word:</p>

<p>&#8220;Traitor!&#8221;</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER VI<br />

<small>SIMON GIRTY, THE RENEGADE</small></h2>


<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Who</span> are they, Pat?&#8221; asked Bob, half
under his breath, as he saw Blue Jacket gravely
salute the other Indian, whom he knew to be
a chief among the fierce Miamis, both by the
feathers he wore in his scalplock, and by the
trimmings on his buckskin hunting shirt and
nether garments.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Injun is Little Turtle, the greatest
chief among the Miamis,&#8221; replied the Irish
trapper, also lowering his voice, for he saw the
two white men frowning in his direction. Bob
noticed that his old friend kept his long-barrelled
rifle close under his arm, and his finger
touching the trigger.</p>

<p>&#8220;And the two others?&#8221; Bob went on. &#8220;I
have never met either of them before, that I
can remember; and yet I have seen most of the
white men who roam the woods in this region
of the Ohio.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wull,&#8221; whispered Pat, &#8220;ye niver missed
much, thin, for, by the same token, there niver<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
lived greater rascals than the same precious
pair ye say before yees this minute. The wan
ag&#8217;inst the tree, wid the scowl on his black face,
is none ither than the infamous Simon Girty;
while his frind&#8217;s name it do be McKee; and
there are hapes av people thot say he be the
blackest renegade that iver wint over till the
Injuns, to wage war on his own kind.&#8221; (<a id="Note_5r"></a><a href="#Note_5">Note
5.</a>)</p>

<p>Both boys heard what Pat said, although he
had lowered his voice to a whisper; and, of
course, they were chilled to the marrow at the
idea of looking upon such notorious persons,
for already their names were being held up to
execration among all honest settlers. Both
Girty and McKee had been seen in the ranks
of the hostile Shawanees when attacks were
made on frontier settlements; and there were
threats going the rounds as to what fate
awaited them should the fortunes of war ever
throw them into the hands of the whites.</p>

<p>To the eyes of the pioneer boys they looked
doubly ugly on this night, when met so unexpectedly
in company with a noted Miami chief,
whose hostility towards the invading palefaces
was so well known.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the two Indians were engaged in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
a conversation that by degrees became more
and more heated. Indeed, neither Bob nor
Sandy could ever remember seeing their young
friend, Blue Jacket, quite so worked up. He
made dramatic gestures when he talked, and
seemed to be replying to the taunts of the older
chief.</p>

<p>It began to look as though there might be
trouble, and Sandy fingered the lock of his gun,
taking a sly look down to make sure that there
was powder in the pan, for the spark from flint
and steel to reach, in case it became necessary
for him to depend on a quick discharge of the
musket.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are they talking about, Pat?&#8221; asked
Sandy; for he knew that the Irish trapper was
able to follow what the two Indians said in their
warm discussion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure, thot scum av the aarth, Little Turtle,
do be taunting Blue Jacket wid bein&#8217; frinds-like
wid the palefaces,&#8221; the other replied, cautiously,
keeping one eye all the while upon the
pair of treacherous renegades, whom he would
not trust for a single second to get behind his
back. &#8220;He tills him thot ivery ridskin ought
to be the mortual foe av the palefaces who
would stale their land away from thim. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
kapes on sayin&#8217; thot he hates the white men as
hotly as the sun shines in summer, and will
niver, niver make frinds wid the same.&#8221; (<a id="Note_6r"></a><a href="#Note_6">Note
6.</a>)</p>

<p>&#8220;But, no matter what he says, it will not
cause Blue Jacket to turn against the Armstrong
family, even if he some day takes up the
hatchet against the whites,&#8221; Sandy went on to
say, with a confidence born of an intimate acquaintance
with the young Shawanee brave,
whose name was also fated to figure in the history
of the times.</p>

<p>&#8220;Av yees could but hear what he do be sayin&#8217;
this blissed minit,&#8221; declared Pat, &#8220;sure, it&#8217;s
on a good foundation ye build yer faith. Listen
to him till that he was sore wounded, and how
ye two byes did bring him intil yees own wigwam,
h&#8217;alin&#8217; his hurts, so that instead av dyin&#8217;
he lived. Now, it is av thot same kind mither
av yees that he do be spakin&#8217;, and how she
bound up his bullet wound wid salve, an&#8217; trated
him as though he might be her own boy. For
thot he can niver be anything but the frind av
the Arrmstrong family. An&#8217; already has he
parrt convinced Little Turtle, becase, ye know,
gratitude is the bist trait av the ridskins.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But now the other seems to be changing his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
talk, and appealing to him in another way.
Tell us what he is saying, Pat, please,&#8221; insisted
Sandy.</p>

<p>The Irish trapper listened for a minute, and
then nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;That wor a cliver shot av Blue Jacket, on
me worrd,&#8221; he muttered. &#8220;Yees say, the ould
chief he do be tillin&#8217; him that his brothers, the
Shawanees, are always on the warpath aginst
the palefaces; and that, while it may be all
right for him to keep frinds wid yer family,
he ought to take up arrms aginst the rist av
the sittlement. But Blue Jacket replied by
tillin&#8217; him av what ye byes did for the great
sachem, Pontiac, only last autumn, and what
it meant for the sacred wampum belt of the
same to be hangin&#8217; in the Arrmstrong cabin.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! yes,&#8221; Sandy went on; &#8220;that ought
to convince Little Turtle that Pontiac is the
friend of our settlement, just because we live
there; and an injury to one would be an injury
to all. All these months, now, while other
places have been attacked, there has come no
evil against our neighbors. Much though they
feared the coming of the Indians, not once has
a hostile shot been fired since that day when
Pontiac gave us his wonderful belt.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;Do you notice, Pat,&#8221; remarked Bob just
then, in a whisper intended only for the ears
of the one he addressed, &#8220;that the man you
called Simon Girty is edging off to the left, a
little at a time? I do not like the look in his
eye. He scowls as though he meant us harm.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis mesilf that do be after watchin&#8217; the
sarpint av the forest,&#8221; replied the trapper.
&#8220;And yees spake rightly whin ye say he has
evil in his mind; but me finger is on the trigger,
an&#8217;, be the powers, wan hostile move on
his parrt manes for me to fire. I cud hit the
eye av a rid squirrel at this distance, and surely
must find his black heart wid me bullet.&#8221;</p>

<p>He spoke louder than before, and for a reason.
Evidently his words must have reached
the ear of the renegade, for he no longer tried to
keep on moving, a little at a time, toward the
left. Doubtless Girty knew well what a splendid
shot Pat O&#8217;Mara was; and also that the
trapper would willingly rid the border of such
a pest, if given half an excuse.</p>

<p>The two Indians had by this time come to
an understanding. What Blue Jacket had told
concerning the gratitude of Pontiac, and the
bestowing of his wampum belt on the young
pioneers, because of their saving his life, must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
have impressed the Miami chief greatly. At
that time Pontiac&#8217;s name was one to conjure
with among the confederated red men of the
region lying between the Alleghenies and the
Mississippi; while Little Turtle had not yet
come to the zenith of his fame.</p>

<p>Turning to his white allies the Miami chieftain
spoke in a rapid tone. Although Bob could
understand only a word or two, nevertheless he
grasped the meaning of what Little Turtle said;
and knew that he was warning Girty and McKee
not to think of injuring either of the boys who
had been taken under the especial protection
of Pontiac, the master schemer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are they going to let us pass on, or do
they mean to start a fight?&#8221; asked Sandy,
whose manner showed that he was by no means
averse to trying conclusions with the two ugly
desperadoes who had thrown their fortunes in
with the Indians, so that they could no longer
find a friendly greeting at the cabin of a single
white settler.</p>

<p>&#8220;No danger of our being halted,&#8221; Bob hastened
to reply, fearful lest the impulsive
Sandy might attempt some sort of play that
would open hostilities, when there was no necessity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;Come, we&#8217;d bist be on our way, av we hope
to rach the sittlement before the flood arrives,&#8221;
said Pat, beginning to retreat, still keeping
watch on the renegades; for no white man who
had his senses about him would ever be so foolish
as to turn his back on such a treacherous
snake in the grass as Simon Girty.</p>

<p>They were soon far enough away from the
camp to feel safe, especially since the keen eyes
of Blue Jacket saw that not one of the three
whom they had left there had made any move
toward following them.</p>

<p>&#8220;How is your ankle going to hold out,
Sandy?&#8221; asked Bob, who feared the worst.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s just got to do,&#8221; was the determined
reply. &#8220;I mean to go on until I drop; but I
shall keep up with you. If the worst comes,
you can leave me behind somewhere, and the
rest push on, for, unless the warning is received,
our people may be caught asleep in
their cabins, and carried away, like that log
was.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sandy was possessed of considerable grit,
inherited from his sturdy Scotch ancestors, no
doubt. When he set those teeth of his firmly
together it meant that he was just bound to
do, or die. And in many a tight hole that stubborn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
trait served him a good turn, just as it
had also gotten the boy into heaps of trouble.</p>

<p>When he limped, Bob threw an arm around
him; or it might be the genial trapper gave
him such assistance as lay in his power. Indeed,
deep down in his own mind, though he
did not say as much, Pat O&#8217;Mara was determined
that if he had to take the lame boy upon
his broad back, as an Indian squaw would her
little papoose, he was bound to see to it that
Sandy reached his home with the rest of them.</p>

<p>But Blue Jacket was familiar with every
trail of the forest. He could lead them over
cut-offs that even the trapper did not know
and which saved many a weary step.</p>

<p>The boys began to recognize their surroundings
after a while, although the night was so
dark that only the general conformation of the
country could be noticed.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re getting there, Bob,&#8221; said Sandy,
hopefully.</p>

<p>&#8220;To be sure we are!&#8221; declared the other.
&#8220;See, that must be the tree we shot the wildcat
from, when he was eating the mink taken
from our trap.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And that means only another mile or so
to go before we reach home,&#8221; remarked the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
younger boy gladly; for Sandy was fast reaching
a point where even his remarkable grit
could not carry him along, and he must admit
defeat.</p>

<p>But every step he knew took him that much
closer to home. Even the thought of his mother
and father, as well as Kate, anxiously awaiting
news of the two who had crossed the raging
river on the preceding afternoon, buoyed him
up, and lent him new strength.</p>

<p>By degrees they were coming near the settlement.
This had been built along a small elevation
on the bank of the Ohio, from which the
pioneers were afforded a magnificent view up
and down the river. At the time of its selection
by Daniel Boone, who had long admired the site
as an ideal place for a growing town, no one
had so much as dreamed that a flood might
sooner or later come sweeping down from the
hills away beyond Fort Duquesne, and threaten
the little colony with disaster. But it had come,
and this night was likely to prove the blackest
in the history of the settlement.</p>

<p>Now they could see the blockhouse that had
been erected on the very crown of the ridge, so
that in times of danger all those having cabins
lower down along the face of the hill might flee<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
thither for refuge. And the wily Indians could
not find any higher point whence to send their
arrows, winged with flame, to stick in the roof
of the fort, and set it ablaze.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can see a light in our cabin window,&#8221;
declared Sandy, presently, his voice trembling
with eagerness. &#8220;See, it is on the side that
looks down the river. I am sure mother must
have put it there to serve as a guide for her
boys, if they chanced to be afloat on the dark
waters. Oh! how glad we will be to see her
again.&#8221;</p>

<p>The roar of the river was in their ears as
they advanced further; but their coming must
have been detected by some sentinel, for a
minute later a harsh voice rang out, calling
upon them to halt and explain who they were,
on pain of being fired on.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s we, Mr. Harkness,&#8221; cried out Sandy,
recognizing the voice of a near neighbor,
&#8220;brother Bob and myself; but with us come
Pat O&#8217;Mara, and our friend, Blue Jacket, the
last bringing news that will tell you his friendship
still holds good. Oh! where will we find
our mother and father; can you direct us, sir?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They are at the cabin,&#8221; replied the sturdy
settler, as they advanced to where he stood,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
gun in hand, &#8220;though I saw Neighbor Armstrong
but a few moments ago, and he was much
cast down because his sons had not arrived.
Hasten then, and convince him of your safety;
and meanwhile we would like to know the nature
of this warning brought by the Indian.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII<br />

<small>THE FLINT-TIPPED ARROW ON THE ROOF</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">As</span> Bob Armstrong and his brother drew near
the well-beloved cabin which had now been
their home for almost an entire year, their
hearts beat high with anticipation of a reunion
with their mother, father and sister.</p>

<p>The door stood partly open, as though, perhaps,
Mr. Armstrong had just entered, to bear
the latest news concerning the rising of the
river to his family circle. And, looking through
the opening thus formed, the boys saw the three
whom they loved standing by the table, on
which still rested the dishes of the evening
meal, as if the fond mother had not given up
all hope that her sons might yet come in, tired
and hungry.</p>

<p>They could see her face as she listened to
what the good man of the house was saying.
It could not have been cheerful news, either, for
the concern deepened on the countenances of
Kate and her mother.</p>

<p>The boys could stand it no longer, but, bursting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
through the door, they were quickly in the
arms of the mother for whom either of them
would have given his young life any day; nor
did either Bob or Sandy deem it unmanly in
the least because tears ran down their cheeks,
induced by their great joy at once more being
home.</p>

<p>Then came many questions; and, as the story
was told, how those fond ones hung upon every
word! No doubt that brave little mother could
see, just as vividly as though she had been
there, her younger boy caught in his own trap,
with that fierce woods tiger creeping closer and
closer.</p>

<p>And then, later, when between them the boys
had described the accident out on the river,
whereby the breaking of the paddle was responsible
for the collision with the great unwieldy
log, and the loss of the dugout, she realized the
peril her sons had been in, even though they
strove to make light of it.</p>

<p>Last of all came the news that Blue Jacket
was trying to fetch to his friends at the time
he and Pat had so opportunely come upon the
floating log in the middle of the Ohio.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let us hope and pray that it may not be
so bad as that,&#8221; Mrs. Armstrong said; for, now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
that her boys had been restored to her, she felt
that she could face almost any calamity with
calmness. &#8220;The Indians may have over-estimated
the force of the water, and it will not rise
higher than our doorstep, at most.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is not very far from that, even now,&#8221;
observed Bob, who had noted before entering
the cabin how terribly near that flowing flood
came to their home, and that already it had
covered the patch of ground where he and his
brother were accustomed to work at odd times,
when not hunting, or attending to their string
of traps.</p>

<p>&#8220;We shall not dare sleep much to-night,&#8221;
declared Mr. Armstrong. &#8220;You see, my boys,
we have been busy, and our few possessions are
already done up, ready to be carried to higher
ground, if necessary&mdash;which we hope may not
be the case.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then came Pat O&#8217;Mara, always a welcome
guest at the Armstrong cabin; for he had always
shown himself one of their best friends.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure, there be some av the settlers who
make light av the direful news Blue Jacket
brings, becase, ye say, &#8217;tis only an Injun that
fetches the same,&#8221; the trapper remarked, after
he had greeted the rest of the family, and joined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
the circle. And then with the boys ate heartily
of the food Mrs. Armstrong had placed before
them.</p>

<p>&#8220;A strange thing happened since you left
home,&#8221; remarked the owner of the cabin, as
he reached out, and, picking something up, laid
it on the heavy table, scoured snowy white by
the hands of the good housewife.</p>

<p>Sandy uttered a cry of astonishment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, look at that, will you?&#8221; he exclaimed.
&#8220;It must be another of those strange warnings
we have been getting for a long time past,
though we can never understand who sends
them, for I can see the same figures marked
here on the birch bark that we settled before
meant those rascally French trappers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Bob, who was closely examining
the little roll of thin bark, almost as light
as a feather; &#8220;I am sure you are right about
that, Sandy; and these two creeping figures
must be our enemies, Jacques and Henri, the
brother of the dead Armand. But where did
you get this, father?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your mother and myself were talking here
late in the afternoon, when Kate came and told
us she had heard a strange sound from the
direction of the roof, just as if some one had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
thrown a stone. I went out, expecting to find
that those small boys of the new settler, Seth
Smalley, had been pelting each other again;
but, when I looked, no one was in sight. Then,
chancing to cast my eyes upward toward the
roof, what was my astonishment to see an arrow
sticking there, to which was attached that
little roll of bark. So I climbed up, and possessed
myself of the whole. I do not much
doubt but that this unknown friend, who has
several times tried to warn us about those bad
men, the French trappers, is again sending
a message which is intended for you two
boys.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What does he seem to say this time?&#8221;
asked Sandy, as, with his brother and the Irish
trapper, he bent over the scroll which was being
held open in the extended fingers of Bob.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here is a cabin, which must be meant for
our own home,&#8221; commenced Bob; &#8220;because,
you see, it has a little flagstaff fastened to the
top in front. Well, two creeping figures are
coming toward the cabin. One of them holds
something in his hand, which I can hardly make
out, but it may be a burning brand. Yes, it
surely is, for here you can see smoke curling
up from the side of the cabin.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;Well, the whole settlement shall know about
it at once,&#8221; declared Sandy, angrily; &#8220;and
it will be a bad thing for Jacques Larue or
Henri Lacroix to be seen creeping up the rise.
I do not believe we will ever know peace until
something happens to those bad men. Little
they care for the sacred belt of Pontiac, and
even the death of Armand Lacroix does not
seem to have daunted them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think you are wrong there,&#8221; Bob went
on, earnestly. &#8220;They have been afraid to do
either of us bodily injury, because they know
what the anger of Pontiac would mean to them.
But they think they can find other ways to
annoy us, and those we care for. To burn our
cabin to the ground seems to be a favorite way
of satisfying their idea of revenge; but they
will have a hard time doing it, now that we are
warned.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I read the scroll somewhat as you do,&#8221; said
Mr. Armstrong, &#8220;and at once commenced to
ask among the neighbors concerning them. One
man, who had been out hunting most of the day,
told about seeing the Frenchmen in the woods.
They seemed to be heading this way, and acted
as though they were making sure of their
ground as they advanced. As he did not fancy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
running into trouble, he simply lay in the
bushes until they had passed on.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Which proves that they are really around
here again, urged on by some foolish notion
that they have suffered wrongs at our hands,
and ought to square the account,&#8221; remarked
Bob, seriously.</p>

<p>&#8220;It will be squared, one of these fine days,&#8221;
said Sandy, with a glance in the direction of
the corner where he had stood his musket after
entering, taking it from the hands of Pat, who
had been carrying the heavy piece for him, because
of his lame leg.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yis,&#8221; spoke up Pat, &#8220;there be but wan
way to aven accounts wid such spalpeens as
thim Frinch trappers, who make most av their
livin&#8217; stalin&#8217; from the traps av honest min;
and that is by diskiverin&#8217; the same in some ugly
thrick, an&#8217; wastin&#8217; a precious bit av lead.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Here comes Blue Jacket to see you,
mother,&#8221; said Bob.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; broke in Sandy, &#8220;if you could only
have seen him when he was telling that war-loving
Little Turtle how much he was in debt
to the Armstrong family, it would have done
you good, mother. Of course we didn&#8217;t just
understand all they said; but Pat could, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
he told us how Blue Jacket was declaring he
would lay down his life for any one of us, if
the need arose. He said you attended to his
hurt just as if he were your own son.&#8221;</p>

<p>It could be easily understood, after that, what
a warm welcome greeted the young Shawanee
brave when he strode into their midst. Doubtless
it was pleasant to him to know that they
thought so much of him; but he did not betray
this fact even by a smile. An Indian learns
from childhood to repress all outward evidence
of feeling springing either from joy or pain.
Anger alone will he allow himself to show, and
that only because it excites his ardor for the
battlefield or to follow the trail of his enemy.</p>

<p>Sandy was waiting to spring something upon
the young Shawanee brave. He had asked his
father for the arrow which had been shot so
as to drop directly on the roof of the Armstrong
cabin. This he suddenly laid before Blue
Jacket.</p>

<p>&#8220;You, who can tell the different arrow-points,
and the way of feathering the shaft, of
every tribe along the Ohio, look at this, and
say whose was the hand that drew the bow from
which it came,&#8221; Sandy went on to say.</p>

<p>Blue Jacket looked gravely at the flint tip<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
that was bound in the cleft of the straight shaft
with strong fibres taken from some plant.
There must have been signs that immediately
informed him as to what tribe the party belonged
who had made that arrow. (<a id="Note_7r"></a><a href="#Note_7">Note 7.</a>)</p>

<p>&#8220;Ugh! Delaware arrow, him,&#8221; grunted Blue
Jacket; and no one dreamed of disputing his
simple assertion; indeed, Pat O&#8217;Mara was seen
to wag his head in a satisfied way, as though
that declaration exactly coincided with his own
private opinion.</p>

<p>&#8220;So, you see,&#8221; remarked Sandy, with an air
of triumph, turning on his brother, &#8220;I always
said I believed it was an Indian who sent those
queer messages; but why do you suppose he
does it? The Delawares as a rule are not in
love with the white settlers. When a colony is
attacked there are generally Delawares among
the reds who creep up to surprise the poor settlers.
Why should a Delaware want to do us
a good turn; tell me that, Bob?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, now, I am just as much in the dark
as you are,&#8221; returned Bob; &#8220;unless that was a
Delaware youth you rescued, Sandy, from that
horrible quicksand late in the autumn on that
day you went out hunting alone.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It might be,&#8221; Sandy replied, looking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
thoughtful; &#8220;he never told me who he was;
but held out his hand to me, and then disappeared
in the bushes, from which fact I made
up my mind that he must have been on a very
important errand at the time he got trapped
in that slough. A Delaware&mdash;well, perhaps
he was. Seems to me he looked like the one
who was caught hanging around here early last
summer, and who was allowed to go, with a
warning never to come back. But I suppose
I never will know the truth.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, it sames to me it&#8217;s a mighty good
thing to have sich a grand fri&#8217;nd always on the
watch till warrn yees whin danger draws nigh,&#8221;
remarked the trapper. &#8220;Now, av I&#8217;d had the
same, &#8217;tis manny a bad time I might have been
saved from goin&#8217; through wid, in me day. And
marrk me worrd, this same party must have a
bad falin&#8217; towards the Frinchmin; becase he
sames to kape watch over them, so he do;
plazed to upset anny plans they might be after
makin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p>Leaving the cabin in the charge of Mrs. Armstrong,
Kate, and Sandy, the last of whom
wished to have some of the home-made salve
applied to his swollen ankle, the rest went out
to watch the rising of the waters, and to compare<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
notes with others among the anxious settlers,
now in fear of having the little homes for
which they had toiled so hard swept away with
the flood.</p>

<p>One who had been keeping close watch over
the situation declared that for more than half
an hour now the river had been at a standstill.
Even such a small thing as this brought some
ray of hope in its train; though Pat warned
them not to relax their vigilance one iota, because
the information sent down the Ohio by
means of those signal smokes was usually very
accurate, and could be depended on.</p>

<p>It was after a time decided to set a watch,
while the rest of the settlers tried to obtain
some sleep, of which they were in much need.
Should the river once more begin to rise, information
of the event would be carried around
quietly from cabin to cabin, so as not to awaken
the women and children, and needlessly alarm
them, even though it were deemed the part of
wisdom for the men to be abroad.</p>

<p>But, in case the water started to rise swiftly,
as would be the case should the flood predicted
by the Indians arrive, then the alarm bell, used
only in cases of great necessity, like a threatened
Indian attack, would be rung.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>Should that be heard, every one must immediately
start to remove all of his possessions,
scanty as these were at the best, to a place of
security on higher ground.</p>

<p>It was an anxious group that gathered there
for a last consultation, before separating for
the night. Bob missed Blue Jacket, and yet the
Indian came and went at will when visiting his
white friends, so that his absence caused no
alarm.</p>

<p>Finally Mr. Armstrong took Bob by the
sleeve, saying:</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, you and Pat, we will return home.
We all of us need sleep, and surely you in particular,
my son, after the excitement of the
perils that hung over your head. Perhaps a
kindly Providence, that has all along watched
over our fortunes, may see fit to ward off this
new and terrible danger. But, if it is to come,
we could not help matters by remaining awake.
Let us then be securing some rest, so as to be
ready to work with a will, in case the worst
comes.&#8221;</p>

<p>Half an hour later perfect quiet seemed to
surround the cabin of the settlers from Virginia;
but, nevertheless, Pat slept, as he himself
expressed it, &#8220;wid wan eye open.&#8221; Besides,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
he kept his long rifle close to his hand;
and Sandy felt positive that, in case there came
any midnight alarm, O&#8217;Mara would be out of
the cabin like a flash, and woe to the skulking
figure on which his eye rested.</p>

<p>Tired out after the labors of the day, and
easily able to throw the burden off his young
mind, Bob Armstrong was not long in going to
sleep, once he had dropped down on his bed,
covered with some of the furs taken by himself
and Sandy.</p>

<p>They had been warned not to undress, lest
there might be need of sudden action with the
coming of the flood. But such a little thing as
that did not bother either of the Armstrong
boys, who were used to roughing it whenever
they went into the woods.</p>

<p>Bob never knew how long he slept; but it
must have been for several hours, because the
fire on the hearth had died down when he
opened his eyes again, and it had been looked
after at the time he lay down.</p>

<p>But the condition of the fire gave the boy
little or no concern at the time he awoke; for,
hardly had he opened his eyes, than he became
conscious of the thrilling fact that it had not
been a dream after all but the alarm bell was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
wildly pealing out its brazen notes; and outside
he could hear men&#8217;s hoarse voices shouting:</p>

<p>&#8220;Up, every one of you! The flood is coming
swiftly, and already the water has commenced
to rise at a fearful rate. Awake! Be up and
doing, if you would save your possessions!
The flood! the flood!&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII<br />

<small>THE TREASURE BOX THAT WAS FORGOTTEN</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">As</span> this thrilling cry rang through the settlement,
supplemented by the wild peals of the
alarm bell in the block house, all the inmates
of David Armstrong&#8217;s cabin were on their feet.</p>

<p>Sleep had been banished as if by magic; indeed,
the boys had never felt more wide-awake
in all their lives. And there was plenty to do,
as well as willing hands with which to accomplish
the labor.</p>

<p>Fortunate indeed did it prove that everybody
had anticipated this sudden necessity, and that
the scanty household goods, some of them precious
only through their associations with that
Virginia of the past, had been so packed that
they could be carried to higher ground, and a
place of safety, in a very brief time.</p>

<p>Indeed, so rapidly was the water coming up
now, that, by the time the last piece had been
taken from the Armstrong cabin it commenced
to trickle over the door-sill. Bob&#8217;s last visit
was made with more or less splashing, as he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
strode around the familiar interior, now looking
so strange with the floor covered by the
flood.</p>

<p>Some of the settlers, Mr. Armstrong among
them, had made use of the strongest ropes they
could obtain, to tie their cabins to convenient
trees, hoping that in this way they might add
to their security. When the strength of the
current and the hulk of those log cabins was
taken into consideration, however, this hope did
not have a great deal to rest upon.</p>

<p>There now seemed nothing left to do but cluster
there beyond the edge of the river, and take
note of its constant rise. All whose cabins were
in danger had saved their goods, and in this
considered themselves lucky. New cabins could
of course be built, since there was wood in
plenty, and stout arms to swing the axe; but
these family possessions could never have been
replaced.</p>

<p>There was one little consolation, slender
though it might appear; the clouds had finally
broken, and the stars were shining. It seemed
almost as though the myriad bright eyes of
heaven were peeping out, to see the extent of
the damage and woe that had been wrought.</p>

<p>Unable to stand quiet and watch the raging<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
waters creep up around the walls of their late
home, the Armstrong boys joined the group not
far away. Fires had been lighted, and the glow
of these added to the weirdness of the scene,
as the settlers moved to and fro, comparing
notes, trying to find comfort in their mutual
troubles, and seizing on the slightest grain of
hope afforded by reports that the crest of the
rise must surely have come, after which the
waters would go down again.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is Pat O&#8217;Mara talking so fiercely
about?&#8221; asked Bob, as he joined the group,
after having been off to see how things were
getting on in the direction of the river; and
Sandy, who had remained where most of the
homeless families had congregated, turned
with a frown on his face.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is about those miserable French trappers,&#8221;
he replied.</p>

<p>&#8220;But what of them?&#8221; persisted Bob;
&#8220;surely we need not fear their setting fire to
our cabin just now; and even Pat, who hates
those men so much, could not well accuse them
of having turned this water loose.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is all very true, Bob; but one of the
settlers has just mentioned the fact that he felt
almost positive he ran across two men, dressed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
like trappers, who were hurrying away from
the settlement. He called out to them, thinking
that they might be friends, but they paid no
heed to his hail. And, as he got to thinking
the matter over, all at once it struck him who
they must have been.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When was it that he saw them?&#8221; demanded
Bob, immediately concerned.</p>

<p>&#8220;It may have been an hour or so ago; about
the time the water was rising around our cabin,
and, unable to bear the sight, we came here,&#8221;
Sandy replied. &#8220;They are all wondering what
could have brought those men here at such a
time; and every one seems to think that it must
have been the hope of laying their hands on
some valuables, while the settlers were given
up to excitement.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That looks like it, Sandy,&#8221; the other replied,
quickly. &#8220;All have piled up whatever
they possess in a heap, not caring where it lies
so long as the waters cannot carry it off. But
people are there on the watch all the time, and
children snuggled down in the midst of the bedclothes;
so it doesn&#8217;t seem as if those men could
find much worth carrying off.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Pat is as angry as a bull at sight of
a red kerchief,&#8221; Sandy continued. &#8220;You know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
how he hates and despises everything that is
French. He vows that, if he can only get one
glimpse of either Jacques or Henri, his rifle
will speak; and it seldom does that without
something dropping.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Were they leaving the settlement at the
time this man saw them?&#8221; asked Bob.</p>

<p>&#8220;That was what he thought,&#8221; his brother
replied. &#8220;When he called out, they seemed to
hasten their footsteps, as though fearful that
he might try to detain them. He says he stood
and wondered who they could be, and why they
refused to answer his hail. It was only when
too late that the truth flashed into his mind.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, if they are gone, let us hope it is for
good,&#8221; remarked Bob.</p>

<p>&#8220;But why should they be around here at all,
when they know the hostility of the English
settlers toward the French?&#8221; asked Sandy.
&#8220;It is always war between them, and especially
in the wilderness where the trap lines run.
Each claims all the country between here and
the Mississippi; together with all the fur-bearing
animals that can be found there. And that
dispute will never be settled without a bloody
war.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps they meant to either try and rob<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
some of the settlers here, or else set fire to our
home,&#8221; Bob ventured to say. &#8220;The coming of
the flood changed their plans; and, as the people
were all aroused, they must have decided
that it was too dangerous for them to stay
around here. And so, at the time they were
seen, Jacques and Henri may have been scuttling
out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How is it at the cabin?&#8221; asked Sandy, with
a tremor in his voice; for, truth to tell, he felt
the impending catastrophe even more than his
brother did, and could not bear to look upon
what seemed to be the doom of their home.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry to say the water seems still to
be rising, and we must not allow ourselves to
cling to much hope that it can be saved,&#8221; was
Bob&#8217;s reply. &#8220;I feel more for mother and
Kate than the rest of us. They sit there among
our goods, white of face, but trying to bear up.
Father cheers them with a few words every
now and then; but they know he only talks that
way because he cannot bear to see them so miserable,
and not that he really believes the flood
is at a standstill.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor father and mother, they have had so
many things to bear with,&#8221; said Sandy. &#8220;We
must try to look cheerful, just for their sakes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
And besides, you know, at the worst it may
mean a change of base for us, Bob.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know what you are thinking of, Sandy,&#8221;
the other remarked, with a shake of his head.
&#8220;That Mississippi idea will not let go of
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But others are really talking about it
right now, Bob, I tell you,&#8221; Sandy insisted,
earnestly. &#8220;You would be surprised to know
how many heads of families are thinking that
it would be a splendid undertaking to leave this
country, where misfortune has overtaken them,
and go further into the golden west. There was
Mr. Harness for one, Mr. Bancroft for another,
and possibly Mr. Wayne. Something seems to
tell me, brother, that the coming of this flood,
terrible though it appears, will be the very
means of making our father decide to go upon
this undertaking. Oh! I hope so! I hope so!
I surely know that it would be for the best;
and that we could have a homestead in that
beautiful wilderness out yonder, that would
far exceed anything ever known along the
Ohio, with its floods and troublesome Indians.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When father makes his mind up, then will
be the time for the rest of us to say what we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
think,&#8221; Bob observed. &#8220;But we must wait and
see. Perhaps, when the waters go down again,
our neighbors will forget what they said this
night, and think it best to rebuild, if their
homes have been swept away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, let us go over, and comfort our
mother again,&#8221; Sandy suggested.</p>

<p>&#8220;A good idea,&#8221; returned Bob. &#8220;This is a
time for us to try to look cheerful, as you say.
We are young, and can stand hardships easily;
but our parents are growing old now, and such
things weigh heavily on them. I&#8217;m with you;
lead the way.&#8221;</p>

<p>They found Mrs. Armstrong and Kate apparently
hunting through the pile of household
goods for something that seemed to be missing.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it, mother?&#8221; asked Sandy, quickly,
scenting possible trouble.</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot find my little treasure box, in
which I kept what few valuables I possessed, as
well as your wampum belt which Pontiac gave
you as a pledge of his constant good will,&#8221; Mrs.
Armstrong replied. &#8220;And, come to think of it,
did any of you bring it out of the cabin? You
know I kept it on that small shelf above the
window.&#8221;</p>

<p>The two boys looked at each other in dismay.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
There was no need to ask if either had seen the
box of valuables, for the expression on their
faces told the story.</p>

<p>&#8220;It must be in the cabin still, then!&#8221; exclaimed
Sandy.</p>

<p>Forgetting his lame ankle, he turned and hurried
away, impulsive as ever; and Mrs. Armstrong
wrung her hands as she appealed to Bob
to stop him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Much as I value the things that are in that
little box, not for ten times their worth would
I have one of my boys imperil his life in the
effort to save them. Go as fast as you can,
then, Bob, and hold your hasty brother in check
before he takes that dreadful risk!&#8221;</p>

<p>Hardly waiting to hear the last word, Bob
was off like a shot. He was just in time, for
as he came upon Sandy the latter had reached
the edge of the water, and was about to start
boldly into the swift current, meaning to swim
out to the half-submerged cabin.</p>

<p>Bob gripped him by the arm, and shouted in
his ear:</p>

<p>&#8220;You must not go out there, Sandy, mother
says! It would be an act of madness. Already
the water is over our heads; and look at the
way the cabin trembles with the force of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
current. It may be carried away at any minute!&#8221;</p>

<p>And Sandy, with a groan, let his head drop
until his chin rested on his chest, for he saw
that Bob spoke truly.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX<br />

<small>THE SPIRIT OF THE PIONEER</small></h2>


<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Oh!</span> there goes the Hutchinson cabin,
swept away down the river!&#8221; arose a cry from
near by; and, looking out, the boys saw that it
was indeed too true.</p>

<p>With the rising of the water the stout cabin
had finally been lifted from its foundations,
and, the last they saw of it, the current was
making a plaything of what had only a short
time before been a happy home.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ours may be the next!&#8221; was Sandy&#8217;s choking
exclamation, as he and Bob continued to
stand there and watch.</p>

<p>Every time there was a lurch to the log building
that seemed to presage its destruction,
Sandy would press his hand over his eyes, as
though he could not bear the sight; and a moment
later the cheering voice of his brother
would assure him that the peril had passed,
at least for that time, as the sturdily-built cabin
still held out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>So the early dawn found the dismal settlement
on the bank of the Ohio.</p>

<p>Men stood moodily about, watching the destruction
of their homes, and feeling very bitter
toward the river that was robbing them so mercilessly.
Again and again did some one turn
the conversation to that subject which had engrossed
the mind of Sandy Armstrong for so
long&mdash;the charms of the rich land to be found
away off toward the region of the setting sun,
where the Mississippi rolled its mighty flood,
and abundance awaited the coming of bold pioneers
capable of turning the black soil that
would grow fabulous crops.</p>

<p>One spoke of the vast herds of buffaloes that
roamed unhindered through the aisles of the
dense forests; another had heard stories about
the vast quantities of the most valuable fur-bearing
animals ever seen, and which could be
easily captured by energetic trappers.</p>

<p>&#8220;And the Indians are not of the same bloodthirsty
stripe as the Shawanees, the Iroquois,
and the Delawares, with whom we have been
constantly threatened,&#8221; was the argument a
third settler advanced.</p>

<p>Sandy hovered around whenever the talk
trended this way, eagerly drinking in all that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
was said. He believed that, if only that wonderful
young forest ranger, Simon Kenton,
were present, he would willingly join his fortunes
with a party that might be made up to
start toward the distant goal, as soon as a
suitable flatboat could be built. And Sandy
only wished he might see the tall, sinewy figure
of the indomitable Kenton striding toward the
fire at that very moment; since his coming
would certainly sway the weak members of the
party toward a conclusion.</p>

<p>Abijah Cook, the toothless old ranger, who
had been entrusted with the task of keeping
track of the river&#8217;s rise, came hastening toward
the gathering at this time. There was something
about the way in which he swung his old
coonskin cap that aroused the curiosity of the
disconsolate settlers.</p>

<p>&#8220;Abijah brings good news!&#8221; some one called
out, as the hunter drew near.</p>

<p>&#8220;The river is surely at a stand!&#8221; called the
man who swung his hunter&#8217;s cap so vigorously.
&#8220;For this half hour it has only risen an inch!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then the worst must be over!&#8221; exclaimed
a distracted father, hurrying off to see if his
cabin had stood through that period of stress
and strain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>It was a scene they would never forget that
greeted the eyes of the pioneers as the day
came on.</p>

<p>Five cabins were no longer where they had
been at the close of the preceding day. They
had fallen victims to the insatiable maw of the
river, and by this time must have been scattered
over miles of the watercourse, as roof and walls
were torn apart by the force of the current.</p>

<p>Sandy was in a fever of suspense. He came
back again and again to see if their cabin still
resisted the grip of the flood.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is a chance that it will hold out to
the end!&#8221; he cried, as the boys stood there
and watched the trembling roof of the home.
&#8220;And, if it does, why we can easily find mother&#8217;s
little treasure box, with the valuables she
thinks so much of; and then there is our wampum
belt, which Pontiac gave us with his own
hands, to show all Indians, who might threaten
us, that we were the friends and brothers of the
sachem. Oh! I would feel pretty bad, I tell
you, if that should be lost.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So would I, Sandy,&#8221; replied Bob; &#8220;because
we&#8217;ve depended on that belt to keep the
torch away from our settlement. Once it is
lost, we are no better off than Boonesborough,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
or any other place around which the
Indians constantly hover, ready to use bullets
or arrows or torch upon the unsuspicious settlers.
But, Sandy, cheer up. If the cabin does
hold out to the end, we are sure to find the
treasure box again; for you know it would float
on the water, and could hardly escape from the
interior, since the door is shut.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve been thinking, Bob,&#8221; returned
the other. &#8220;But when will the water
go down enough for us to cross over and find
out the truth? Every minute seems like a
whole hour to me; and the hours are like
days.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, we can&#8217;t hurry the old river a bit by
getting excited,&#8221; Bob continued, knowing of old
the nervous nature of his brother; &#8220;so the best
we can do is to try to make our mother and sister
comfortable. They have gone into the blockhouse,
you see, and it is there we must carry
some of our belongings; for the women and
children will have to sleep there for some days.
Even the cabins that are left standing will be
so water-soaked that it would never do for children
to sleep in them until they are dried out
by fires.&#8221;</p>

<p>And so, in this labor of love, even Sandy was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
enabled to forget, for a time at least, his troubles
and anxieties.</p>

<p>The river, while at a stand, had not as yet
started to go down, though by night, the older
and more experienced among the settlers declared,
they might expect to see some difference
in the height of the waters.</p>

<p>Many anxious eyes were cast upward toward
the heavens during the morning; and hardly a
fleecy cloud that came sailing into sight but was
viewed with more or less fear, lest it turn into
a vapory billow that would quickly overspread
the blue arch, and let down another torrential
rain.</p>

<p>But the air was clear and crisp, and in truth
it had apparently cleared up for good, as if
Nature were satisfied with the damage already
wrought.</p>

<p>The big blockhouse had been built with the
thought that, in case of an Indian attack, it
would be called on to hold all in the little settlement.
Around it a high stockade or palisade
had been erected, behind the shelter of which
the defenders might hold their own against the
crafty foe, shooting through loopholes that had
been made for guns.</p>

<p>It was a two-story affair, the upper projecting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
a foot or more beyond the lower, as was the
ease with most blockhouses built in those dark
days, when enemies were apt to spring up in a
night, surrounding the fort, and striving by
every device known to savage ingenuity to encompass
its destruction.</p>

<p>There were small openings in the floor of this
second story where it overlapped the lower
walls, and through these the defenders might
protect the log foundations from being set on
fire by the red fiends who had besieged the
occupants, and were bent on their destruction.</p>

<p>After all, it could be made fairly comfortable,
and, as there is more or less consolation in
having companions in misery, the women were
beginning to pluck up a little heart, looking to
the coming of better times.</p>

<p>Those whose homes had been carried away
were promised the assistance of every strong
arm in the community, in the effort to provide
them with new cabins, for, being so utterly
aloof from contact with civilization, the pioneers
were dependent on one another for everything
that went to make up life.</p>

<p>Of course the boys could not long keep away
from the bank, where they might look out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
toward the upper part of their submerged
cabin and speculate on its ability to hold out
to the end.</p>

<p>As the day wore on their hopes kept rising
and falling. Sandy, in particular, changed his
mind about every ten minutes. Now he was
certain that the good old cabin was bound to
defy the power of the flood to move it from its
foundations; then again he would call out that
he feared it must be about to give up the fight,
because he had seen its walls shake in a way
that told they were near collapse.</p>

<p>But noon came and went, and found things
just about the same as when dawn broke over
the cheerless scene. True, another cabin had
succumbed to the rush of swirling water, so
that six in all had been destroyed; but that
circumstance alone need not fill them with dismay,
since new abodes could be erected, before
many weeks had passed, that would in
all probability be an improvement on the
old.</p>

<p>Around the fires the men gathered in clusters
to talk over the situation, and exchange opinions.
And every time Bob chanced to draw
near one of these groups he discovered, to his
surprise, that much of the talk was about the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
chances of a venturesome party reaching the
fertile prairie land away off to the west, by following
the course of the Ohio.</p>

<p>Apparently, then, Sandy had spoken truly
when he declared that the seed had taken root
in the hearts of several of the heads of families;
and Bob found that even his own father
seemed to be as deeply interested in the project
as any of the others.</p>

<p>The very idea gave Bob a thrill. To the bold
pioneer, be he boy or man, there is always something
very fascinating about heading into the
unknown land. Somewhere ahead there always
exists a wonderful country where marvellous
things may be done. Just as the lure of gold
led men to cross the wide plains to California
so this feverish desire to possess the land appealed
to our forefathers, and tempted them to
brave the perils that lay in wait along unknown
trails, all leading westward.</p>

<p>Some of the men who had lost their hard-earned
homes were especially bitter concerning
the location which had been picked out for them
by Daniel Boone; just as though the frontiersman
could ever have foreseen such an astonishing
rise of the river as this flood had been,
greater, the Indians declared, than had ever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
been known before, as far back as their traditions
went.</p>

<p>But these grumblers declared that the place
must have some sort of curse resting upon it.
They had met with troubles without end ever
since coming across the mountains to the new
country on the Ohio.</p>

<p>To continue to bear up under the oppressive
yoke was asking too much of them; and, as they
scorned the very idea of returning to Virginia,
there seemed but one alternative, which was to
move on further into the wilderness, found a
new home there, and profit by being the first
English families to penetrate that hitherto unsettled
region.</p>

<p>After they had eaten some lunch, which made
things appear a bit more cheerful, as a meal
always does, the boys again wandered down to
the edge of the river, to look out over the flowing
tide, and speculate on its fast subsidence;
for they had made marks themselves, and
knew by these that the flood was losing its
grip.</p>

<p>Sandy was feeling much more cheerful now.
He even expressed the opinion that they were
sure to find the little treasure box floating
around inside the cabin, once they could get<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
out to see. And certainly the precious wampum
belt, that spelled safety for the Armstrong family,
no matter what tribe of Indians they happened
to meet, could not be much injured by
a mere soaking.</p>

<p>Bob had heard the changes rung upon this
subject half a dozen times during that half of
a day; and he fully anticipated finding his
brother breaking out into another lament before
half an hour had passed, as the whim seized
him.</p>

<p>Nor was he mistaken about this, though the
cause came from a quarter least expected. It
was while the boys were standing there, watching
the flow of the flood, and commenting on
the fine stand taken by the Armstrong cabin,
which must always reflect credit on its builders,
themselves included, that Sandy gave a sudden
exclamation that seemed to sound an
alarm.</p>

<p>&#8220;After all,&#8221; he cried out, in a distressed
tone, &#8220;we have been building our hopes on a
sandy foundation. The dear old cabin has stood
up against all the pull of the river; but, see
yonder, there comes a great tree floating down,
as if it was in a mill race; and as sure as anything
it&#8217;s headed straight for our poor home.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
Once that strikes against the wall, we can say
good-bye to the Armstrong cabin. Oh! it&#8217;s
hard to have to stand here, and not be able to
lift a hand to save mother&#8217;s home!&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X<br />

<small>THE CABIN THAT BRAVED THE FLOOD</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">There</span> was nothing that mortal hand could
do to ward off the impending peril that threatened
to take the Armstrong cabin down the
river, after those of the other settlers that had
gone before.</p>

<p>That huge forest monarch was coming along
with majestic power, borne on the swift current,
and apparently headed straight for the
half-submerged cabin that had made such a gallant
fight against heavy odds.</p>

<p>&#8220;If it hits the cabin, there can be but one
end!&#8221; Bob was forced to say aloud.</p>

<p>&#8220;But is there any chance at all that it may
pass by without striking?&#8221; demanded Sandy,
unconsciously gripping the sleeve of his brother&#8217;s
fringed hunting coat in his excitement,
while his eyes were glued to the fearful object
that was causing this new alarm in his heart.</p>

<p>&#8220;A small one; hardly enough to build on,&#8221;
replied Bob, soberly. &#8220;It all depends on the
current right here. I noticed some time ago<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
that it seems to make a sharp swerve away
from the shore. Perhaps that may be just
enough to send the tree on a new tack, and
spare our cabin.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! I hope so; I hope so!&#8221; murmured
Sandy.</p>

<p>&#8220;But we shall know the worst in another
minute,&#8221; declared Bob; &#8220;for it is coming
along pretty fast now.&#8221;</p>

<p>The two boys stood there, almost holding
their breath in suspense, their eyes fixed on the
object that held so much terror for them. Of
course they would hate to see the dear old cabin
go; but, after all, that was not what gave them
the most concern. There was that little treasure
box, that held the few valuables of their
mother; and, besides, that precious belt, which
meant more to the pioneer family than untold
gold, as it spelled protection from Indian
perils.</p>

<p>&#8220;There, it is at the point where the outward
sweep begins; but will such a big object be influenced
by so small a change in the current?&#8221;
Bob was saying.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can begin to see a shaking of the branches
that stand up, as if they felt a new hand at the
helm!&#8221; declared Sandy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, yes, that is so!&#8221; cried Bob, almost
as keenly aroused as the excitable Sandy.</p>

<p>&#8220;It moves, Bob, it moves! I can see it begin
to swerve! Oh! if the cabin were only fifty
yards further down-stream, I do believe it
would escape!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And it may yet. Wait and see!&#8221; answered
Bob, watching the course of the tree with a critical
eye.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is swinging around, so that the branches
begin to turn toward the cabin. If anything
strikes, it will not be the heavy butt, but the
lighter end. Perhaps our home may be able to
stand out against that sort of a blow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There! it&#8217;s coming now!&#8221; cried Bob.</p>

<p>The scraping of the branches, as the tree
swung around, was plainly heard. Sandy gave
a gasp. He imagined that he saw the log structure
start after the floating tree; but in this
his fears magnified things, for it did not happen.</p>

<p>Instead, the cabin remained just where it had
always stood, while the floating derelict of the
flood passed on to its destiny.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hurrah!&#8221; exclaimed Bob, waving his cap
enthusiastically.</p>

<p>For the moment poor Sandy was incapable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
of making a single sound. He trembled violently,
gasping for breath, and could only give
his brother a wan smile in exchange for his
warm greeting; such was the nervous effect the
crisis had upon the excitable lad.</p>

<p>But presently Sandy became himself, and was
bubbling over with joy because fortune had been
so kind to them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! look!&#8221; he shouted a little later,
&#8220;what can that be on the big log out yonder?
It seems to me like a black bear.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And that is just what it is,&#8221; replied his
brother, after a careful survey.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, as sure as anything, it must be, for
I saw him move his head then,&#8221; Sandy went on.
&#8220;It makes me think of that panther in the tree
that was floating down the river once, when we
had our adventure with him. But how in the
wide world do you suppose he came there; and
why doesn&#8217;t he swim ashore? Bears can swim,
all right, Bob; isn&#8217;t that so?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To be sure they can,&#8221; replied the other;
&#8220;but I imagine that bear must have been in
a treetop, and changed his location to the log,
as being better to his liking. He is pretty far
out, you see, and perhaps the swift current
scares the poor old fellow; so that he thinks he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
had better hug close to his craft, and let it carry
him along where it will.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just to think how he takes that voyage into
the unknown world without a single care,&#8221; remarked
Sandy; &#8220;and why should pioneers be
afraid to accept the dangers of the wilderness
boldly, when they are in force? Think of him
getting ashore, hundreds of miles it may be
from his starting place, which he will never see
again. I suppose that is one of the ways different
kinds of wild animals are given a start
in new sections of the country.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have been told that by Daniel Boone, who
has looked upon so many strange things in his
day,&#8221; Bob went on. &#8220;See, the bear is looking
toward us now, as if he wonders what sort of
creatures these two-legged things can be. But
he is safe from our guns out there, and can keep
on his ride in peace.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is Mr. Armstrong?&#8221;</p>

<p>This question was asked by a neighbor, who
had his small son by the arm; and Bob could
not but notice that Mr. Wayne looked somewhat
concerned.</p>

<p>&#8220;Over this way, sir, you will find him; I
will show you where,&#8221; Bob answered; and
Sandy trailed along, too, as if he believed that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
the settler had some particular reason for wanting
to see their father.</p>

<p>As Mr. Wayne was one of those who had been
talking most vehemently about emigrating further
west, Sandy chose to think that his mission
now might have some bearing on that issue.</p>

<p>But it did not. On the contrary, both boys
were astounded to hear what Mr. Wayne had
to say, when presently he came upon their
father.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was the boy who saw them,&#8221; the settler
started to say, as he glanced down at his son,
about eight years of age, and rather a manly
little fellow. &#8220;It was at the time we were all
so excited last night that we missed him. I
hunted wildly around, as perhaps you may remember;
and when I began to fear he had been
carried off in the river, I finally discovered him,
standing there on the bank, watching the water
by the light of the fires.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I remember,&#8221; remarked Mr. Armstrong,
as the other paused for breath; &#8220;but
you have something more to tell, because I do
not see how this has any connection with my
affairs, neighbor.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait,&#8221; the other went on, &#8220;and you will
see whether it has or not. Only a little while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
ago my good wife called me to her, and said
that Rufus had been making certain remarks
about two strange men he saw, and that she
thought he ought to repeat in my hearing. So
I questioned the lad, and learned this. While
he was standing by the water&#8217;s edge last night,
after you and your family had gone up to the
blockhouse with all your possessions, Rufus
saw two burly men, who were dressed like Kenton
and Boone, he says, pass out to your cabin,
Mr. Armstrong, and enter by the door!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; exclaimed Sandy, with his usual impulsiveness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Those terrible French trappers!&#8221; murmured
Bob; &#8220;what could they want there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They did not stay inside very long,&#8221; the
settler continued; &#8220;and then, after looking out
in a queer way, as if they did not wish to be
seen, he says they hastened to the bank, and
went sneaking off, down-river way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But why did he not tell this before?&#8221; asked
Mr. Armstrong, plainly disturbed by the news.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you see, he is only a child,&#8221; the other
went on; &#8220;and, in the excitement of the hour,
it passed from his mind; or else he thought
they might have been some of the men of the
settlement whom he did not know. But it came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
back to him a little while ago, and he started
talking about it in a way to attract the attention
of his mother, who listened long enough to make
sure that I should know. And so I have brought
him here, that you might question him further
if it so pleased you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am afraid they must have been those
scoundrels,&#8221; said Mr. Armstrong; &#8220;but what
could have induced them to take the chances
they did in entering my cabin? I can only account
for it in one way. They wanted that wampum
belt which it is known my sons possess,
and which entitles its possessor to the good-will
of nearly every tribe of Indians between the
Alleghanies and the Mississippi. That is why
they have been hovering around here so long,
waiting for a chance to search our home. And
it came in a way they had perhaps never
dreamed of.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But surely the precious belt is safe with all
your things in the blockhouse?&#8221; remarked Mr.
Wayne.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is the worst of it,&#8221; replied the other
settler; &#8220;in our excitement we came away and
forgot the little treasure box, which the good
wife kept on a shelf above one of the windows.
Besides a few valuables, which she would grieve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
to lose, it also holds that wampum belt of the
great chief, Pontiac.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In which case, the chances are that those
rogues have discovered it, and carried it off
with them,&#8221; suggested Mr. Wayne.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am afraid so,&#8221; answered Bob&#8217;s father,
disconsolately.</p>

<p>The two boys were chilled by the thought.
After all, was the cabin to stand through the
flood, and then a bitter disappointment await
them when they entered the familiar room, in
the hope that they would find safe the object of
their solicitude?</p>

<p>They hurried back again to the bank, and
looked out to where their half-submerged home
still stood. Until they were able to reach the
door, and pass within, neither of them could
know peace again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! will the old river ever go down again,
so that we can reach the door and know the
worst?&#8221; Sandy groaned as the afternoon wore
slowly away, and the glowing sun sank toward
the west that constantly lured his thoughts away
from the region of the Ohio.</p>

<p>&#8220;But it is falling, and very fast now!&#8221; declared
his brother, who had been examining the
marks closely and eagerly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;But what are a few inches, when we will
have to wait until it goes down six or more
feet?&#8221; grumbled Sandy; but nothing was to be
gained by complaining, and finally the boys concluded
to camp right there on the bank, where
they could keep watch through the night, so that
no one might pass out to the cabin without being
seen in the light of the fire they would keep
burning.</p>

<p>And this was what they did. One slept while
the other stood sentry, always keeping an eye
on the cabin.</p>

<p>The river went down very fast during the
hours of darkness; and there came no fresh
alarm to stir the tired souls from slumber. So
another morning found them; and the first
thing Sandy noticed was that the cabin stood
free from the flood at last, though in the midst
of a wrecked garden.</p>

<p>&#8220;We can enter now!&#8221; he exclaimed to his
brother.</p>

<p>They took off their moccasins, and waded
through the pools of mud that lay in place of
the garden spot of a few days before.</p>

<p>It required considerable force to push open
the door, because the water had swollen the
wood; but by putting their shoulders to the task<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
in unison the boys finally managed to swing it
inward.</p>

<p>Then they entered, and looked around, holding
their very breath in an agony of suspense.
The cabin had several inches of mud on the
floor, and its appearance would have struck
dismay to the heart of the neat housewife, had
she seen it just then. But Bob and Sandy were
not thinking of this. They let their eyes roam
all around the room, seeking a sign of the well-remembered
little box in which their mother
kept those small articles she prized; and which
had also been the receptacle in which the wampum
belt had last reposed.</p>

<p>But only blankness met their view.</p>

<p>The little box was surely gone; and if, as
they suspected, those bold intruders had been
the French trappers, Jacques and Henri, then
it was apparent that finally the fortunes of war
had placed them in possession of the article
which they would prize more highly than almost
anything else that could be found&mdash;the belt
decorated with the little shells, and known as
wampum, which was marked with the signet of
the great war chief and sachem, Pontiac, and
would protect its possessor against the fury of
the confederated red men of the wilderness.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI<br />

<small>DANIEL BOONE, THE PILOT OF THE SETTLERS</small></h2>


<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Well</span>, that settles it!&#8221; said Sandy, disconsolately,
as he looked at his brother.</p>

<p>&#8220;The box is certainly gone,&#8221; replied Bob,
trying not to show his feelings more than he
could help, because he felt sure Sandy must be
close to the breaking-down point.</p>

<p>&#8220;And we&#8217;ll never see our fine belt again,&#8221;
continued the other. &#8220;I wonder if the chief
would feel like giving us another, in case he
learned of our losing this one?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid that&#8217;s out of the question,&#8221; Bob
returned, with a shake of his head. &#8220;In the
first place, how could we hope to see Pontiac,
when by now he may be many hundreds of miles
away from here, for he belongs up near the
lakes, where the Pottawottomies have their
lodges, along with the Sacs and the Chippewas?
Then again, even if we dared take that adventurous
journey, and escaped all the perils of
the wilderness, perhaps Pontiac would believe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
he had done all he should for us, and refuse
to hand over another belt. I&#8217;m afraid we&#8217;ll
never set eyes on that wampum again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Unless,&#8221; remarked Sandy, with the sanguine
nature of youth, &#8220;those trappers should
strike out for the trading posts along the Mississippi,
and we&#8217;d happen to run across them,
some time or other. And I can tell you this,
Bob, if ever I do meet with either of those rascals,
I&#8217;m bound to make him hand over our
property.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe you would,&#8221; declared Bob, his
own eyes snapping as he saw the look of determination
on the face of his brother.</p>

<p>It was a hard task for Bob to inform his
parents of their loss. Sandy shirked the unpleasant
duty, and remained away while his
brother went to find the others. He was moody
and silent the rest of the day, a most unusual
circumstance for one possessed of so bright and
sunny a disposition. In the course of time this
feeling would wear off in a measure, but the
loss of that valued wampum belt was going to
worry Sandy more than a little.</p>

<p>The river continued to fall very rapidly, and,
in the course of a few days, might be expected
to get back into its natural channel. But there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
was no great eagerness shown by the settlers
to rebuild the wrecked cabins.</p>

<p>Truth to tell, the more they talked about making
a bold push further westward, the stronger
the idea began to appeal to them; until it was
now almost an assured fact that several families
would throw their fortunes in together,
build a staunch flatboat, with a large log cabin
on it, upon which they could embark, with their
few household necessities, and trust to fortune
to carry them safely through what perils might
lie in wait further down the Ohio.</p>

<p>It was just two days after the flood went
down, that a council of war was called among
the families most directly interested in the new
venture. These were, besides the Armstrongs,
the Harkness, Bancroft and Wayne people, and
several others who were as yet uncertain what
course to pursue.</p>

<p>It was in a serious frame of mind that they
gathered there in the open, to talk over what
plans they had better arrange, looking to a
migration from the settlement on the bank of
the Ohio to new fields.</p>

<p>Every scrap of information that could be unearthed
was made to do duty over again. Mr.
Armstrong had become very much in earnest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
now, and he was held in such respect by the
others that his change of front had considerable
influence in causing the Waynes to decide.</p>

<p>Of course the younger element had nothing
to say in this meeting; but that did not prevent
them from listening with the deepest interest
as the question was debated from all
sides.</p>

<p>Sandy, especially, was filled with enthusiasm.
His pet project, over which he had spent many
a sleepless hour, now seemed in a fair way of
being realized. Long had that mysterious West
held out tempting hands toward the pioneer
boy. Just as Daniel Boone had come to believe
that it was his destiny to open up the wilderness
to settlers, and plant new colonies in the
midst of fertile lands; so this lad, apparently,
had for some time felt that it was to be his fortune
some day to look upon that grand river,
discovered by De Soto, which but few whites
had ever set eyes on, save the French traders
and trappers, and they did not count for much,&mdash;in
Sandy&#8217;s estimation, anyhow.</p>

<p>In the end there were just the four families
who bound themselves together in a little league,
resolved to attempt to better their conditions
in this bold manner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>Some there were, among the others, who disliked
exceedingly to see them make preparations
for leaving, and threw all manner of trifling
obstacles in the way. Whenever they had the
chance they would work upon the fears of the
women belonging to the four households, by
narrating all manner of harrowing tales of the
terror that lay in wait for unfortunate voyagers
down that mysterious lower Ohio.</p>

<p>But women were made of pretty good stuff
in those early days, and especially the wives of
the pioneers. They had always faced trials that
would easily daunt their weaker sisters of to-day;
and believed that their place was beside
the loyal men who were their only protectors,
and who stood ready to lay down their lives for
those they loved.</p>

<p>There were others who, while they disliked to
see their friends leaving them, were ready and
willing to do everything in their power to assist
the enterprise. These loyal ones gave many a
hard day&#8217;s work, helping to fetch in the timber
for the flatboat, and hew the straight logs that
were so necessary for its construction. Their
good wives sacrificed some of their treasured
stores in order that those who were following
the beckoning finger of adventure might have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
an abundance with which to start their new
life.</p>

<p>Bob and Sandy worked hard, too, bringing
in game that could be cured after the Indian
method, so that there need be no lack of food
aboard the flatboat, when once they started on
their long journey.</p>

<p>The trapping season being over, the boys collected
their traps, and oiled them before storing
them away, ready to be packed with their
other belongings. Sandy loved to picture the
glorious time they would have in their new surroundings,
with not a white man, possibly,
within hundreds of miles, and the whole wilderness
to draw upon for furs and game and
fish.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope you may never be disappointed,&#8221;
Bob used to say to him, after listening with a
smile to one of these periodical outbursts.
&#8220;But you know things are not always what they
seem. There may be plenty of game away out
there, and lots of fur-bearing animals; but what
do we know about the new dangers that we are
apt to face? I do not speak in this way before
our mother and sister; but, between us, I do
not like the idea of being closer to those French
than can be helped. They are a villainous lot,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
as father says, and hold all English as their
mortal enemies.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, on the other hand,&#8221; Sandy would reply,
shrewdly, &#8220;there is a change of heart coming
to these same French. Have we not heard
it said that, should the Colonies break away
from the Mother Country, and rebel, France,
being at war with England, would be on our
side? That might make some of these rascally
French trappers our so-called friends. I should
not like that, and especially in the case of
that precious pair, Jacques Larue and Henri
Lacroix, whom I hope to meet face to
face, at the muzzle of my gun, some happy
day.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Indians were beginning to show their
teeth again, in a manner that was not at all
reassuring to the settlers who would make up
the reduced colony, after the flatboat had started
down the Ohio.</p>

<p>Judge of the delight of the settlers, when one
fine day, who should appear at the colony that
he had helped to found, but the backwoodsman,
Daniel Boone. He was on his way to Boonesborough,
and in haste at that, for the attitude
of the Shawanees had become so threatening
that there was danger of the struggling little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
settlement falling into the hands of the savages.
(<a id="Note_8r"></a><a href="#Note_8">Note 8.</a>)</p>

<p>He was keenly interested in all that had gone
on since his last visit, and was pleased when
told that the bold adventurers had decided to
take their fate in their hands, and proceed far
into the land of the setting sun. Such a move
his spirit could easily sympathize with, for most
of his life had been taken up with just such
splendid and hazardous enterprises.</p>

<p>&#8220;If only I had the time,&#8221; he said to Mr.
Armstrong, &#8220;dearly would I love to accompany
you in this venture, for I myself have long
wished to set eyes on that wonderful Mississippi
of which you speak. My best wishes will go
with you; and, if a written word of mine may
do you any good by the way, you shall have
it for the asking. Even among the Indians I
have a few good friends; for they know me
as an honorable enemy in time of war, and one
whose word once given is never broken.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sandy was of course anxious to know about
the young hunter whom he admired so much,
often the companion of Boone; and, when he
had a chance, he made inquiries. The frontiersman
had by no means forgotten Bob and Sandy,
and, indeed, one of his first questions when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
he met Mr. Armstrong had been of them, and
what new adventures they had been having of
late.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have not seen the young man for some
time,&#8221; Boone had answered, when Sandy made
his inquiry. &#8220;The last I heard of him, he had
gone to the Ohio, and was at Fort Washington,
I believe. So that there is always a slight
chance that you may run across him during
your voyage.&#8221;</p>

<p>Of course Boone was able to give them a great
deal of information, as well as warn them
against the tricks of the sly Indians, who would
be likely to resort to all manner of devices in
order to overpower the travellers.</p>

<p>&#8220;Above all things,&#8221; he urged upon the men
of the party before taking his departure that
same afternoon, to rejoin his companions,
camped not many miles away, &#8220;beware of the
white man who appeals to you from the shore,
and tells a pitiful story of having been captured
by the Indians, from whom he has but recently
escaped. The chances are as ten to one that
he is but one of those villainous renegades like
Girty, McKee or Butler, who act as decoys for
their swarthy brothers; and that he only means
to lure you close to the shore, so that they can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
pour a deadly volley into your midst, and board
the boat in the confusion.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But what if his story should be true?&#8221; objected
Mr. Harkness. &#8220;We should feel like
murderers if we abandoned a poor wretch of
our own color. And surely success could not
come to an expedition founded on cruelty.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your first duty is toward your own families,&#8221;
spoke up Boone, sternly. &#8220;If, then, his
story is true, demand that he enter the river,
and swim out to you, while you hold the boat
stationary by the anchor, but at a safe distance
away. If he refuse to do this, and suddenly
disappear, see to it that you lay low, for there
will immediately rain a tempest of bullets and
deadly arrows from the bushes, behind which
his red allies lie hidden.&#8221;</p>

<p>In this strain, then, did the great pioneer
warn those who were about to trust themselves
and their precious families to the waters of the
lower Ohio. Hearing all he said, both Sandy
and Bob were greatly impressed, and secretly
resolved to profit by the advice.</p>

<p>Boone admitted that it was a great misfortune
to have lost that magic wampum belt of
Pontiac&#8217;s, which he had seen on a former visit.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know Pontiac, and how far his influence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
goes with nearly every tribe between here and
the Mississippi,&#8221; he said; &#8220;and there will be
many times, I fear, when you will deeply regret
that you did not hold tighter to his gift, as it
would save you from troubles that ever beset
the pioneer&#8217;s life.&#8221;</p>

<p>When Boone shook hands with every soul in
the settlement, kissed the babies, and hurried
away, to head for his own little settlement, there
was not one among them but felt that the mere
presence of such a man was a tower of strength
to any struggling community on the border of
civilization.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII<br />

<small>STARTING FOR THE NEW WEST</small></h2>


<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">The</span> great day has come at last!&#8221; said
Sandy, early one morning, as they started down
toward the river from the blockhouse, where
they had been quartered ever since the flood,
their cabin having been occupied by a family
with a numerous brood of young children, whose
shelter had been carried away by the ruthless
waters.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Bob replied, stretching himself;
&#8220;days and weeks have crept along, and this has
been a busy hamlet, what with the rebuilding
of cabins, planting crops for those who expect
to stay, and the fashioning of our flatboat, with
its strong cabin on deck. A busy time, everybody
says.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But our boat is done at last!&#8221; Sandy declared,
joyfully; &#8220;and most of our things are
packed aboard, for to-day we make a start,
headed for the Mississippi!&#8221;</p>

<p>Bob looked at his brother a little uneasily.
He himself was feeling more or less sad, because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
there were friendships that must be severed;
and the chances seemed to be that they would
never again shake the hands of some of those
who had come out from Virginia with them.</p>

<p>But Sandy seemed to have no thought of this.
His father, mother, sister and brother were
going along; and what need then to feel distressed?
That was the way the light-hearted
lad felt about it; and the one great dream of
his young life seemed about to be realized. For
many months he had yearned to set eyes on that
mysterious and mighty river, that rolled toward
the far-off gulf; and whose source was as yet
a sealed book to the world.</p>

<p>Sandy had hardly slept a wink all through the
preceding night. Instead, he tossed on his pillow,
and kept picturing what the future would
have in store for them in that beautiful land
toward the setting sun.</p>

<p>No doubt the little mother also lay awake;
but for different reasons. Brave wife of a pioneer
that she was, surely Mrs. Armstrong must
have looked into the future with something of
uneasiness. Many wild stories had she listened
to from the lips of Pat O&#8217;Mara and other valiant
souls, who had penetrated part of the distance
toward the Mississippi; and doubtless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
these all came to haunt her now, magnified by
the fact that they themselves were about to go
forth into that wilderness to build a new home,
under conditions that no one could faithfully
picture.</p>

<p>She managed, however, to conceal much of
her womanly fears from the eyes of her loved
ones. There were dangers everywhere, and as
they supped with them each day that they
lived, it was no wonder that by degrees even
the women learned to hold peril in contempt.</p>

<p>&#8220;Looks like it might be a fine morning for
a start,&#8221; Sandy remarked, as they drew near
the edge of the flowing current, at a place where
a ledge afforded an excellent foothold, when
they wished to bend over and wash their faces.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, the spring is here in truth,&#8221; replied
Bob, &#8220;and the birds are singing in every tree.
After all, this is a beautiful spot, and I fear our
mother is not one-half so anxious to leave it as
the rest may be.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But just wait till she sees what a glorious
country we are going to,&#8221; declared the ever-sanguine
Sandy. &#8220;The birds may sing here,
but it&#8217;s nothing to what they will do out there,
where the land is so rich that it grows everything
they want to eat. And as for game, why,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
just think of seeing a whole herd of buffaloes
that no man could count! Oh! I do wish we
were there right now. It has been a long time
since we shot a buffalo.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s so, Sandy,&#8221; replied Bob, just a little
enthusiastic himself; &#8220;and if things are half
as fine as we&#8217;ve been told, we ought to soon have
a splendid little settlement, with a stockade, and
gardens, and cabins that will make it home to
us.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sandy bent over, and splashed for a minute.
He thoroughly enjoyed the cooling water, and,
indeed, the boy was never so happy as when
swimming, having taken to it when a mere lad.</p>

<p>Then he broke out again, showing that, try
as he might, he could not keep his thoughts away
from the one great subject that held them like
a magnet.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve got all our traps oiled, and stowed
away on board the flatboat, you know, Bob; and
won&#8217;t we have the time of our lives, once we
get settled in our new home, with the snow beginning
to fly next autumn? I&#8217;m glad now that
I traded for those five traps Adam Shell had.
It gives us nearly double as many as we had
before.&#8221;</p>

<p>So they chatted as they finished their cleaning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
up. Meanwhile the women were busily engaged
in getting the last meal that they expected
to take among those whom they had known so
long.</p>

<p>There were not many tears shed, for these
hardy souls were accustomed to meeting all
sorts of happenings with the fortitude that
makes heroines. Indeed, Mrs. Armstrong admitted
to herself that this parting did not cause
one-half the wrench that came when they pulled
up stakes, away off in Virginia, and first set
out on the trail over the mountains, headed into
the great West. Then they knew nothing of
the Indian country, and a thousand fears assailed
them; but now, the yell of the savage
foe had become familiar in their ears, and surely
little that was new in the form of peril could
be awaiting them on their further journey. It
was but the turning over of the page and beginning
a second chapter in a tale that had already
been started.</p>

<p>After breakfast had been disposed of, there
was a great confusion all through the little settlement.
Work of all kinds was at a standstill
for that morning, as all wished to add their mite
to giving the adventurous families a hearty
send-off.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 327px;">
<img src="images/i153.jpg" width="327" height="500" alt="flatboat on river" />
<div class="caption">&#8220;AT LAST THEY WERE AFLOAT ON THE OHIO, BOUND INTO THE
UNKNOWN COUNTRY THAT LAY FAR AWAY TO THE WESTWARD.&#8221;</div>
</div>

<p>Before the sun had mounted three hours high
in the eastern heavens the last word had been
spoken; and amid the cheers of the assembled
people, old and young, the ropes that held the
large flatboat to the shore were cast off.</p>

<p>At last they were afloat on the Ohio, bound
into the unknown country that lay far away to
the westward. Day after day, and week after
week, they expected to continue to float ever
onward, spending the daylight in making such
progress as lay in their power, and either anchoring
at night in the stream, or else, if it were
deemed safe, tying up to the shore.</p>

<p>Again and again had they listened to the sober
warnings from those who expected to stick to
the old settlement. And now the current had
taken hold of their clumsy, but staunch, craft,
and was commencing to hurry it along, as
though anxious to sever the last ties binding
them to these good friends.</p>

<p>By degrees the shouts died out in the ever-increasing
distance, and the bold pioneers began
to pay more attention to their duties.</p>

<p>Then a bend of the river shut out the last
glimpse of the waving hats and kerchiefs, and
a great silence came upon the scene, broken only
by the creak of the big steering oar, or the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
gurgle of the river against the planking below.</p>

<p>The start had been made, and all seemed well.
They were headed into a wilderness that was
next to unknown, and it had required almost as
much courage for these valiant souls to thus
break away from the settlement, and start upon
this voyage of discovery, looking for a new
homestead in the wilds, as was shown by Christopher
Columbus, when, braving the traditions
that declared the world to be flat, he set sail
into the western seas, under the firm conviction
that in this manner he could reach the East
Indies.</p>

<p>On board the flatboat things soon began to
assume a settled condition. Mr. Armstrong had
been unanimously elected the leader of the expedition,
and every member was bound to yield
him obedience.</p>

<p>System had been early established, and each
one knew just what was to be expected of him
or her, so that there was no confusion.</p>

<p>The household goods, save what might be
needed in the way of coverings for the night,
or additional clothing, had been stowed away in
as compact shape as their ingenuity could devise;
and in the hold of the boat a place had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
been found for the accommodation of this material.
It consisted chiefly of a few household
treasures, handed down from ancestors across
the seas. The pioneers did not possess much
in the way of furniture. Tables, beds and chairs
they expected to make afresh when they had
reached the Promised Land. A few strong
oaken or cedar chests, bound in brass it might
be, contained their belongings for the most part;
with what few cooking utensils that were
needed, these latter also in brass or copper,
which was much used in those early days.</p>

<p>Besides the Armstrongs, the passengers and
crew of the flatboat consisted of three families.
First there was Mr. Harkness and his wife, a
fourteen-year-old daughter named Susan, and
also a nephew, one Amos Terry, from New England,
and with some of the peculiarities of
speech that even at this early day marked the
difference between those whose ancestors came
over on the <i>Mayflower</i>, and the descendants of
those settling in Virginia or Carolina.</p>

<p>Then there were the Bancrofts, father,
mother, and three children, all of the latter
rather small; and the Waynes, who had a boy,
Rufus, about eight years of age, and a small
baby.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>Two more persons there were aboard the boat
at the time of leaving. Pat O&#8217;Mara, the good-natured
Irish trapper, meant to stick to his
friend, Mr. Armstrong, through thick and thin,
in this new venture, feeling partly responsible
through having told the wonderful tales that had
so stirred the ambitions of these voyagers.
Blue Jacket, also, was with them, though he only
expected to go a few days&#8217; journey into the west,
when he would say good-bye, and return to his
people, never expecting to see these white
friends again.</p>

<p>Seven men and two boys capable of bearing
arms constituted their full fighting force; a
pitiful company when one considers the nature
of the dangers that were always awaiting the
hardy pioneers whenever they cut adrift and
pierced the wilderness. But such a thing as fear
was next to unknown to any of them; and, as
they turned successive bends of the river, always
unfolding some new and beautiful feature
of the remarkable scenery, both men and women
felt that surely good fortune must await them
in the favored land beyond.</p>

<p>They were not much given to sentiment. The
hardships of that time made people very practical;
and yet no nature could withstand the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
magnificent sunset that greeted their eyes,
hours later, when many miles had been left
behind.</p>

<p>It must have seemed to some of those who
stood and drank in the glorious picture with a
feeling almost of awe, as though the sun had
never before gone down in the midst of such
splendor and that he was beckoning them onward
to where their new homes were to be
founded.</p>

<p>And yet, no doubt, as some of the women
glanced at the grim forest-lined shore so near
by, they must have shuddered, remembering
how somewhere in the dark recesses of that
wood, savage foes lurked, hating the venturesome
paleface who threatened to steal away
their lands, and only too eager to pounce down
upon the little expedition, could they find the
means.</p>

<p>Blue Jacket went ashore as soon as the boat
was tied up for the night, in order to scout
around, and ascertain whether there might be
any signs of hostile Indians in the vicinity.
Pat O&#8217;Mara also took a little turn, and both
reported that the coast appeared to be clear,
so the voyagers took heart of grace, and supper
was cooked in comfort.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>There was no loud talking or laughter. Even
the children had been admonished to keep quiet,
leaving their boisterous play until the morrow,
when, safe on the bosom of the broad stream,
they might give vent to their exuberant spirits.</p>

<p>All through the night a watch would be kept.
Much of that duty was to be undertaken by Blue
Jacket and Pat, who had no family cares to
attend to; but every man slept on his arms, as
it were, ready to leap to his feet at the first
alarm, with a clear idea as to the duties devolving
upon him in case of an attack.</p>

<p>The ropes were arranged so that they could
be instantly cast off, and the boat swung out
into the stream, which, being quite deep just
there, would prevent the enemy from wading
out after them.</p>

<p>While part of the force performed this duty,
the others would send a hot fire in among the
Indians; and it must be remembered that in
pioneer days every woman had learned to handle
a gun almost as well as the male members
of the family.</p>

<p>The first night passed, fortunately, without
any alarm; which was a good thing, since it
gave them all a chance to get accustomed to their
strange surroundings. Later on, after they had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
fallen into the new ways, if trouble came, as
they fully anticipated, it would find them better
prepared to meet the situation.</p>

<p>All were early astir on the following morning,
except that Pat and Blue Jacket still lay
under their blankets, since they had been
ashore part of the night, and secured scarce
any sleep at all until an hour before dawn.
The men were busy, getting wood aboard with
which to make a small fire if necessary, a stone
hearth having been constructed for this purpose,
when, suddenly, Sandy made a startling
discovery.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! look! Bob, look, up there on the roof
of the cabin!&#8221; he exclaimed; and Bob, turning
his eyes toward the boat, quickly saw the object
that had thus excited the other.</p>

<p>&#8220;Another arrow, with a birch-bark message,
just as sure as anything,&#8221; he cried, turning a
puzzled face toward Sandy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me climb up and get it!&#8221; cried the
younger lad; and, with the words, he immediately
started to clamber up the rough side wall
of the cabin, which had been made as near bullet-proof
as possible, so as to afford protection
in case of an Indian attack; for the French traders
were selling the savages hundreds of firearms,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
and even teaching the warriors how to
use them in place of the more primitive bow
and arrows.</p>

<p>Presently Sandy came back, bearing the arrow
in his hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is exactly like the other, which Blue
Jacket told us was surely made by the hands of
a Delaware brave,&#8221; he said, holding the object
up before his brother.</p>

<p>Bob, just as he had expected, found a small
piece of thin birch bark rolled about the arrow,
near the head, and secured there by means of
fibres taken from some plant.</p>

<p>Opening this, he discovered a series of crude,
but plain pictures, made after the fashion of
the Indians.</p>

<p>&#8220;This time there are many figures, and, as
they have scalplocks, they must be Indians,&#8221;
Bob remarked, as he and Sandy eagerly examined
the message that had come from their unknown
friend.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; the other boy went on, &#8220;and see
how they are lying flat behind bushes; while
this must be the river flowing along. Some have
guns, and others bows. And, if you please, Bob,
this must be meant for our fine flatboat, though
it looks more like an old ark than anything else.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
What do you make of that part of the message!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! it stands but for one thing, a warning
to beware of the foes who lurk on the shore,
waiting to take us by surprise. But we
already have been told all about such dangers,
though this kind friend may not know
that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But see, Bob, there is more to it this time,&#8221;
Sandy continued, eagerly. &#8220;Here is our proud
boat again on the river, and on the shore stands
a man, holding both his hands out. He is surely
a white man, because he has a hat on. And I
think he must be begging us to come to the shore
and take him aboard.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is just it,&#8221; Bob remarked, &#8220;and
you remember what Daniel Boone warned us
against. This must be that terrible Simon
Girty, or his companion, McKee, for if you look
once again, you will see those forms concealed
behind the grass and bushes, just as the panther
lies in wait for a deer at the salt lick. Is that
all plain to you, Sandy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, and I would have seen through it, even
if you hadn&#8217;t spoken. But here, for the third
time, we have received a message from this
friend, who keeps his face hidden, so that we do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
not know who he is. What does it mean, do
you think, and who can he be?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He must have some object,&#8221; replied Bob,
his brow marked by a line of perplexing
thought; &#8220;and he certainly has a reason for
not letting us know who he is. If it is that
young Delaware you helped, he has a queer
way of paying back his debt. But, after all,
he is only an Indian, and how can a white man
understand his ways? We must show this to
father, even if it doesn&#8217;t seem to tell us anything
new.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Sandy, drawing a long breath,
and glancing at the forest so close at hand;
&#8220;anyhow, it&#8217;s nice to know we&#8217;ve got a friend
who watches over us all the time. There may
come a day when his warning will save us from
a terrible danger. Delaware brave or not, I
am going to thank him for it, if ever I meet
him face to face.&#8221;</p>

<p>As they had already been told all about these
perils, the men did not experience any fresh
alarm from seeing the message of the arrow.
Mr. Armstrong, thinking it wise to keep all
such causes for uneasiness away from the
women as much as possible, bade the boys
not to mention finding it on the roof. Plainly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
the unknown Indian must have shot it from
some point close at hand, though how he had
managed to approach the boat, unheard by the
keen, listening ears of Blue Jacket or Pat
O&#8217;Mara, was a mystery to both Bob and
Sandy.</p>

<p>If he could do this, what was to prevent a
dozen, or fifty, of his kind from accomplishing
the same thing? It was a thought calculated
to cause a timid person considerable uneasiness;
and possibly this was what had influenced
Mr. Armstrong in his desire to keep the
women from hearing about the arrow that bore
the new warning.</p>

<p>Again they were floating on the current, that
bore the adventurers along at the rate of some
four miles an hour. While the river changed
its course from time to time, so that they
headed now southwest, and again toward the
northwest, still their constant progress was
such that they had the morning sun behind
them; and, when the orb of day passed the
zenith, it beckoned them onward until, nearing
the horizon, its slanting rays warned them
that another night lay ahead, with the dangers
that darkness must ever bring in its
train.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>And so it would go, as the days slipped by,
many miles being covered between daybreak
and darkness, and each span taking them further
into the unknown country.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII<br />

<small>BLUE JACKET GIVES WARNING</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Three</span> days had now passed.</p>

<p>All this time the flatboat had made good
progress down the river, which continually
opened up new and most beautiful pictures to
the eyes of the voyagers. It was very slow
travelling, to be sure; but then the early pioneers
had never ridden on a lightning express
train, nor sat in an automobile that was flying
along country roads at the rate of a mile a
minute; so such tedious progress was not irksome
to them.</p>

<p>One night only had they anchored out from
the shore, when Blue Jacket and the Irish trapper
did not like the idea of tying up to the
trees on the bank, having discovered some
signs of Indians about.</p>

<p>As yet there had been no attack upon the
people on the flatboat, and perhaps a feeling
of renewed confidence was beginning to steal
into their hearts. But the men knew better
than to allow such immunity from danger to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
render them a particle less cautious. And each
evening they kept up the same programme that
had been first instituted.</p>

<p>One man was to be on guard aboard the boat,
constantly watching the shore for signs of anything
moving. He had his orders to shoot, if
an approaching figure, upon being challenged,
failed to give the correct password. And then
every one of the others knew just what his part
of the defence was to be, so that they would
leap to their stations as one man.</p>

<p>After supper on this night, when they were
tied up again to the shore, Blue Jacket went
away to scour the immediate vicinity, and keep
on the alert for the first signs of an impending
attack.</p>

<p>It was to be the very last night of the young
Shawanee among them; for he had announced
that, since they were now far away from the
lodges of his people, he must on the morrow
shake the hands of his white friends in farewell,
and turn his face toward the rising sun.</p>

<p>The boys would be sorry. They had come to
think most highly of Blue Jacket; and Bob
predicted that, in time to come, the young
brave would make a name for himself among
his people. (<a id="Note_9r"></a><a href="#Note_9">Note 9.</a>)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<p>The young moon was now getting of a size
to give considerable light for much of the
night, and this fact afforded every one much
satisfaction, since it took away from the gloom
of the dense forest, that was peopled with
unknown evil things.</p>

<p>Sandy and Bob sat on deck, after supper
had been eaten, and the younger members of
the expedition were being put to sleep in the
cabin. Some of the men were smoking their
long pipes, and talking in low tones near by.
Doubtless they felt well pleased over the way
things were going, and their conversation may
have been along about the same lines as
marked that of the two lads.</p>

<p>&#8220;Three good days, and all is well,&#8221; remarked
Sandy, who had a fishing line over the
side, with which he expected to take in a number
of fine prizes before thinking of sleep.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, and if this sort of thing would only
keep up right along, nobody would complain,
that I know of,&#8221; Bob added; for he was feeling
very comfortable after the good supper he
had enjoyed a short time before.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! that was a fierce bite, all right!&#8221;
exclaimed Sandy, giving a jerk to his stout
line; &#8220;and I&#8217;ve got him, too, I do believe!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
My goodness! how he pulls, Bob! Now, I hope
he doesn&#8217;t break loose! This must be the biggest
fish I&#8217;ve had hold of yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bob, of course, offered to lend a hand in
order to get the prize in; but Sandy, with all
a fisherman&#8217;s ardor, would not think of allowing
such a thing.</p>

<p>And presently, after a deal of pulling, and
expressing fears that he might lose his hard-fighting
prize, Sandy managed to drag the fish
aboard. It proved to be a very large specimen
of what has since become known as the buffalo
fish, found along the whole length of the Ohio,
and which is considered fairly good for the
table.</p>

<p>To these people of the early days such a
feast was always eagerly welcomed; and, of
course, all the women had to come out to see
the noble proportions of Sandy&#8217;s capture, even
the children following, filled with delight because
it meant a feast for all.</p>

<p>Although the persistent fisherman kept up
the good work, and landed several more of the
same species of fish, none approached in size
his first capture; but, then, by the time Sandy
was ready to take in his line, for he was yawning
sadly, the moon had crept along to top the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
trees toward the southwest, and he had secured
an abundance for their temporary wants.</p>

<p>Sandy had just completed winding up his
line on the piece of smooth wood he had prepared
for this especial purpose, when suddenly
the voice of the sentry was heard calling
out:</p>

<p>&#8220;Who goes there? Speak, and give the
countersign!&#8221; for Mr. Armstrong had organized
his little company very much on a military
basis.</p>

<p>Of course every one started up, and many
a hand reached out for the gun that was always
kept within reach, day and night. Sandy
and Bob were no exception to the rule, and
they scrambled to their feet, as, from the tree-lined
shore, came the word that had been selected
for the night:</p>

<p>&#8220;Washington!&#8221;</p>

<p>It was Blue Jacket, coming hastily aboard.
His actions told that he must be bringing important
news; and a thrill swept through the
hearts of the two lads at the prospect of immediate
danger.</p>

<p>Mr. Armstrong was the first one to meet the
Indian as he came crawling over the side of the
flatboat, which stood rather high out of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
water, despite the load it carried, thanks to
the splendid construction of the craft.</p>

<p>&#8220;Get away&mdash;quick&mdash;many Indians, like
the leaves of the forest&mdash;come creep up
through trees. No say what, but slip loose,
and run!&#8221; was the way Blue Jacket expressed
himself.</p>

<p>Upon hearing these significant words, every
one started to carry out his special part of
the duty of freeing the boat. There was no
noise&mdash;no confusion; and this spoke well, not
only for the brave hearts that were aboard
the boat, but for the rules of discipline instituted
by the commander.</p>

<p>Two men jumped ashore, and proceeded to
unfasten the ropes; though really this could
have been done from aboard, as the painters
had been so fastened that all it required was
a strong pull. Others stooped to grasp the
long, stout push poles, with which to urge the
unwieldy craft ahead. Once in the clutch of
the current, of course that part of the business
would be ended; though they might continue
to drop the poles over, and strain their
backs, as long as they were able to touch bottom.</p>

<p>Others, still, crouched, guns in hand, ready<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
to commence shooting at the first indication of
the presence of the fierce enemy.</p>

<p>Everything worked smoothly. The ropes
were unfastened, and brought aboard, without
any trouble. Already a load was lifted from
the hearts of the voyagers; and this lightened
still more when they could feel the heavy craft
beginning to move in response to the muscular
efforts of those who were straining at the
poles.</p>

<p>Soon the sweeps could be brought into play,
when their movement would become more
rapid. Eager eyes scanned the line of trees
from which two dozen feet of sand and water
now separated them. At any second they expected
to see dusky figures leap into view, followed
by the crash of many guns. Looking to
such a contingency, Mr. Armstrong had sent
around a whispered caution that at the very
first appearance of the wily foe everybody
should shelter themselves as best they could
behind the rampart afforded by the gunwale
of the flatboat, expressly built up for this purpose.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think they are really coming?&#8221;
whispered Sandy, as he and Bob crouched
there, sheltered by the heavy bulwark, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
keeping their eyes fastened on the edge of the
forest.</p>

<p>&#8220;Some of the men are already beginning to
say that Blue Jacket must have heard a buffalo
passing, or deer hunting for new feeding
grounds; and that, after all, it may be only
a false alarm; but I do not believe that can
be. You know, Sandy, how wonderfully he can
tell just what every sound means, when they
seem alike to us. If Blue Jacket says there
are Indians afoot in the forest this night, I
feel sure it must be so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! I thought I saw what looked like a
feathered head thrust out of the bushes up
yonder!&#8221; exclaimed Sandy.</p>

<p>Hardly had he spoken than a single shrill
yell rang out. It seemed to be some sort of
signal, and it must have conveyed the information
that the boat was slipping away; for Bob
felt sure he could detect both rage and disappointment
in the loud cry.</p>

<p>&#8220;There, that tells the story!&#8221; he exclaimed,
as he nervously handled his musket, and made
ready to give a good account of the bullet it
contained, if called up. &#8220;Blue Jacket knew
what he was saying, just as I told you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But we are far enough from the shore to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
be safe from an attack,&#8221; declared the other
lad, joyfully; &#8220;and moving further out in the
stream every second, now that they&#8217;ve got the
big sweeps to working. Let the Indians come,
for all I care. They will be sorry if they try
to swim out to us, with that fine moon shining.
Why, we could see their heads easily, and hit
them every time.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sandy might have gone on talking in this
boastful strain, only that his words were deadened
by a chorus of angry yells that broke out
all along the shore. It was as though the savage
enemy had been creeping forward in a
long semi-circle, meaning to close in on the
tied-up flatboat, and render escape impossible.
And now, on discovering that those they had
expected to make their victims were really
beyond their reach, they gave vent to this expression
of their furious rage.</p>

<p>And women shuddered, while children held
their very breath in fear, when they, for the
first time on the voyage, heard the savage outburst
that told of red-skinned foes lurking
within the depths of the primitive forest, eager
to wipe out every member of that brave little
expedition.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV<br />

<small>A TARGET FOR ARROWS AND BULLETS</small></h2>


<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Lie</span> down, everybody!&#8221;</p>

<p>It was the voice of Mr. Armstrong that uttered
these words; and hardly had the men
who manned the sweeps and poles thrown
themselves flat, than there came flashes of
flame from the border of the trees, accompanied
by the crash of firearms and the thud
of striking bullets in the stout bulwark, behind
which they had sought shelter.</p>

<p>Other missiles splashed in the water, falling
short, or passing beyond the boat. Arrows
also struck the cabin, to remain imbedded there
as evidence of the muscular arms that sent
them aboard.</p>

<p>But there was a way of working the sweeps
from behind shelter; and so, by slow degrees,
the imperilled pioneers were carried further
and further from the shore.</p>

<p>No one fired back. In the first place, they
saw but little of the Indians, who held the
marksmanship of the borderers in too high<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
respect to risk showing themselves needlessly.
And then, besides, ammunition was too precious
and costly a commodity to waste, unless
the necessity seemed great.</p>

<p>Gradually the firing from the shore slackened,
and finally died away altogether, as did
also the cries of bitter rage and disappointment.
Only for the warning of Blue Jacket
the little company might have met with disaster
thus early in their adventurous voyage.
There were no longer heard murmurings because
they had been compelled to make this
hasty departure from so comfortable a resting-place.
Indeed, every one was grateful to the
young Shawanee, because of what he had done.</p>

<p>Blue Jacket wanted not their thanks. He
had no love for the white men, who were coming
to drive his race away from the lands where
they had lived for many generations, carrying
on their wars with neighboring tribes, hunting
the buffalo and the deer, and worshipping the
Great Manitou after the fashion of the red
men.</p>

<p>He sat by himself, moody and silent. Perhaps
he was thinking how sorry he would be
to part forever from the two paleface lads
whom he had grown to care for so much in this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
year he had known them. And then there was
the kind, motherly woman who had helped
nurse him back to life long ago, when he suffered
from a severe bullet wound, received in
a battle with the whites, and which would have
caused his death had he not been found by
Sandy, and taken into the care of the Armstrongs.</p>

<p>Then again, it might be that the young Shawanee
brave was feeling the bitterness of his
situation, placed as he was in a position where,
for the time, he felt compelled by gratitude to
warn these palefaces against the coming of his
own people. Perhaps it was well that no shot
had been fired from the flatboat; had a single
Indian been killed as a result of his warning,
Blue Jacket would have cause for feeling more
moody than was now the case.</p>

<p>The boys must have guessed something of
his feelings, for they did not attempt to break
in upon his solitude, as he sat with bowed head.</p>

<p>For several hours the voyage down the river
was continued by moonlight; and then Mr.
Armstrong gave orders that they head in
toward the shore, and put out the anchor that
had been brought along for the purpose.</p>

<p>A strict watch was kept until dawn; then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
Blue Jacket, going on shore, soon signalled
that there was no longer any danger; accordingly
the boat was pushed in, and, some of
them landing, started a fire, at which the breakfast
of fresh fish was cooked.</p>

<p>So the waters and the woods were all made
to pay tribute to the demands of the sturdy
early settlers. The rivers were teeming with
fish, and the forests contained innumerable
deer, buffalo, and much smaller game, so that
it was easy as a rule to supply the table, if a
hunter dared venture abroad. Fear of an Indian
surprise was the only thing that deterred
them. There was ever this dread possibility
hovering over their heads in the disputed land.</p>

<p>When the meal was over, Blue Jacket, with
the same grave face that always marked his
character, came up, and held out his hand to
Mrs. Armstrong.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-bye!&#8221; he said simply, with not a
muscle quivering, such was the splendid control
he had over his feelings.</p>

<p>To Bob and Sandy he also gave his hand,
and looked at them long and earnestly, but said
only that same one word:</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-bye!&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he turned and strode away, never giving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
any of the others so much as a single look,
for they were nothing to the young Shawanee
warrior, and, if ever he met any of them again,
it would probably be with weapons in his
hands, and hatred for the mortal enemies of his
race in his Indian heart.</p>

<p>Neither of the boys ever saw Blue Jacket
again, since their life trails parted there on
the flowery bank of the beautiful Ohio. Destiny
led them into the wilderness, to help clear
a path for advancing civilization; while the
same power took Blue Jacket back into the
villages of his people, to carry out the scheme
in life to which he was appointed.</p>

<p>For a full hour after he had gone Sandy sat
there, looking out upon the river as the heavy
craft glided steadily on its way, saying not a
word to any one.</p>

<p>Then all at once he called aloud:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! there&#8217;s a man down on that point
below, and a white man, too! He seems to be
in trouble, for he beckons to us all the while,
and yet seems afraid to shout out. Perhaps
he&#8217;s escaped from the Indians who tried to
catch us napping last night. It looks to me as
if he wanted us to push in, and take him
aboard.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<p>Instantly every one rushed to that side of
the boat to look. And, sure enough, there
stood a white man, waving his hands to them
in a most beseeching manner. His whole appearance
would indicate that he had suffered
all sorts of recent privations and was both
hungry and desperate.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shall we push in closer?&#8221; asked Mr.
Wayne, who knew less about Indian trickery
than any one of the other men of the party.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not a foot!&#8221; declared Mr. Armstrong;
&#8220;and every one keep low behind the shelter
of the sides; for, by my faith, I fancy, even
now, that I can see dusky figures gliding along
back there among those trees.&#8221;</p>

<p>The man, as they came opposite, commenced
to run along the edge of the shore, and make
more urgent gestures than before.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t desert me, if you be men with
hearts!&#8221; he cried out, in seeming agony.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who are you, and what ails you?&#8221; demanded
Mr. Armstrong.</p>

<p>&#8220;My name is Elijah Fish, and with my mate
I was taken prisoner by the bloodthirsty Shawanees
a moon ago. They have tortured us
both, and my comrade finally fell a victim to
their savage hatred. I managed to escape four<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
days ago, and they have been hunting for me
ever since. If you leave me here, they will
surely find me, and take my life. I beg of you
to pull in at least part way, and let me come
aboard!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He talks straight, seems to me,&#8221; declared
young Amos Terry. &#8220;I don&#8217;t see no sign of
any Indians, and for one I&#8217;d hate to think I
left a poor white man to be put to death. Ain&#8217;t
there some way he might be saved, Mr. Armstrong?&#8221;</p>

<p>For answer the leader of the expedition put
his hands to his mouth, using them for a trumpet,
and called aloud:</p>

<p>&#8220;We cannot come in any closer, because we
must not risk chances of being beset by the
Indians; but, if you wish to come aboard, why
not enter the water, and swim out after us?
That is your only chance, Elijah Fish, which,
for one, I do not believe to be your name.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, who do you take me for?&#8221; asked
the man, still running along the sandy strip
of shore between the edge of the water and the
forest.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you might be the renegade, Simon
Girty, or perhaps McKee. And so we must
refuse to risk the lives of all on board in order<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
to do you a good turn. If you can swim, enter
the water. We will immediately anchor the
boat, and wait for you to come aboard. But
that is as far as we dare go!&#8221;</p>

<p>The man ceased running at hearing this.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yew must have broken his heart with that,
Mr. Armstrong,&#8221; said the Yankee, Amos
Terry.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look again!&#8221; exclaimed Sandy, quickly.</p>

<p>The man was shaking his clenched fist after
them, and, even as they looked, he uttered all
sorts of horrible threats. Some one on board
fired a shot, and the bullet threw up the sand
close to the feet of the fellow, who, taking the
hint, made haste to disappear in the bushes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Keep down!&#8221; called Mr. Armstrong; and
hardly had he spoken than there was heard a
crackling of guns here, there and everywhere
among the trees, showing that the red foe had
been cunningly concealed, in the hope that the
defenders of the flatboat might be lured into
approaching the shore.</p>

<p>This time those on board answered the fire,
as they caught glimpses of dusky figures dodging
from tree to tree.</p>

<p>The duel of guns was kept up for some little
time. Many a bullet, as well as dozens of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
feathered barbs, struck the bulwarks or cabin
of the flatboat; but, since the white defenders
were wise enough to keep themselves well hidden,
little damage resulted from the furious
bombardment, one man alone receiving a slight
wound from a bullet, that must have glanced
off the side of the cabin wall.</p>

<p>On their part the pioneers believed that they
had struck a number of the enemy, although
they could not be positive about this, since they
had not seen any actually fall. The Indians,
however, found that they were getting more
than they bargained for, and when another
half-hour had passed the firing ceased.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope they&#8217;ve given it up as a bad job,&#8221;
remarked Sandy, who had sent several shots
during the exciting time. &#8220;I wonder if I
really did wound that brave who was lying in
that clump of bushes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think you must have hit him,&#8221; Bob replied;
&#8220;because, as soon as you fired, he came
tumbling out, and plunged into that hole behind
the three trees, and I&#8217;m sure he acted as if
something bothered him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s so, Bob, he did make me think of
the way I got around when that hornets&#8217; nest
upset, and they all came out to get at me. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
felt pretty warm for me just then; and I guess
it did for that brave. But, do you think they
have drawn off, and mean to let us alone?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid that in some way, perhaps by
means of the smoke signals, we know about,
they may send word down the river of our
coming; and that would mean, you know,
Sandy, a continual war all along the line to
the Mississippi. I&#8217;m afraid we&#8217;ll have only
too many just such fights on our hands, before
we get to where we want to settle down.&#8221;</p>

<p>But even such a prospect did not daunt the
spirit of Sandy, which was not easily crushed.</p>

<p>&#8220;We have shown how easy it is to keep the
Indians off, and we can do it again and again,
as long as our powder and ball hold out,&#8221; he
declared, with the sanguine nature of youth,
that borrows no trouble when the skies seem
clear. &#8220;I&#8217;m sure Pat O&#8217;Mara must have laid
more than one of those yelling rascals low, for
every time he fired I saw him nod his head and
look pleased.&#8221;</p>

<p>All the rest of that day they floated on, undisturbed
by any signs of an enemy. Once
Sandy discovered a stately stag standing knee
deep in the water, surveying the approaching
craft as if in wonder, and, eager to land a shot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
that might give them a bountiful supply of
fresh venison, the boy made a hasty jump for
his gun.</p>

<p>But perhaps it was this sudden movement
on the part of the impetuous Sandy that
alarmed the deer, for, whirling like a flash, it
vanished amidst the brush that at this particular
spot lined the bank.</p>

<p>&#8220;Too bad!&#8221; said Pat, who had witnessed
all this; &#8220;but, take me worrd for it, Sandy, av
yees had been more deliberate like in your
movements, chances are ye might &#8217;a&#8217; had a
shot. &#8217;Tis the same ould story av too much
haste, me bye. Next toime r&#8217;ach out yer hand,
slow like, and pick up the gun widout takin&#8217;
yer eyes off the game.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sandy thought he might do even better, and
keep his musket in his grasp; but, though he
sat there faithfully for nearly two hours, the
chance did not come again. It seldom does,
once we allow it to slip past.</p>

<p>Of course, on that evening they decided that
it was too risky to think of going ashore to
make their fire; and so supper was prepared
on board, after they had anchored.</p>

<p>So anxious were they to get as far as possible
below the scene of their encounter with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
the treacherous renegade and his red allies,
that they would have continued the voyage by
moonlight, only that it had clouded up with
the coming of late afternoon, and there was
every prospect of a bad night ahead.</p>

<p>The weather had been very fair ever since
the spring rains ceased; but, warmer weather
having now arrived, Mr. Armstrong warned
them that a storm was liable to swoop down
upon them at any time, and they must be prepared
for it.</p>

<p>So, on this night they tried the best they
could to have the anchor well laid, for, if ever
the wind came sweeping down the river, there
was a chance that the cabin of the flatboat
would offer such a resistance that, sooner or
later, they must be swept away, to find themselves
at the mercy of the storm. And that was
a possibility none of them fancied very much.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV<br />

<small>A HUNT FOR FRESH MEAT</small></h2>


<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">I feel</span> just wild for fresh meat, and I mean
to ask father if we can take a little hunt this
very afternoon,&#8221; said Sandy, two days later,
while the flatboat was speeding quite merrily
down the current.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; remarked his brother, &#8220;I would
like a chance to get ashore and stretch my
legs, just as much as you do. And I hope he
says yes, when you ask him. Fish is pretty
good, but a fellow gets tired of it as a regular
thing, and I don&#8217;t think that is the finest kind
of fish either, that we get. Why, when you
took in that slippery mudcat, and we had it
for dinner, it tasted better to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We haven&#8217;t seen a solitary sign of Indians
since they tried to get us to come in to the
shore,&#8221; Sandy went on. &#8220;And that must have
been Girty, himself, who rumpled up his hair,
and tried to look so hard pushed. You remember
we saw him that time after we got ashore,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
when our boat was smashed, and when Blue
Jacket told that Miami chief, Little Turtle,
why he stood up for the Armstrong boys. But
I&#8217;ll come back and let you know what father
says.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ten minutes later he approached Bob again.</p>

<p>&#8220;You needn&#8217;t say a single word,&#8221; remarked
the other, &#8220;for I can tell by the look on your
face that it&#8217;s all right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, he says that we have been making
such good time we can afford to lose an afternoon,
or part of one, in order to try to get some
fresh meat, because we all feel the need of it.
So, before the sun is more than half-way down
the sky, he will give orders for the boat to be
tied up, if everything looks safe, just like it is
right now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad of that,&#8221; declared Bob; &#8220;because,
after being used to walking nearly every
day, for miles and miles, it comes pretty hard
to just sit here, push a sweep, or tramp up and
down around the cabin.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! I just couldn&#8217;t stand it much longer!&#8221;
cried Sandy. &#8220;I was really thinking that I&#8217;d
have to jump overboard, and swim ashore, to
try my luck, if father didn&#8217;t want to stop
the boat, hoping to catch up with you all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
below, when you hauled in for the night
camp.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bob looked uneasily at his impulsive younger
brother.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know whether you are joking when
you say that, or not, Sandy,&#8221; he remarked;
&#8220;but it would be a foolish move to make, and
would bring more worry to the heart of mother.
I hope you won&#8217;t think of such a thing at any
time. You are getting too big now to let these
things have hold of you so much. There are
enough troubles to bother our parents without
you adding to the burden.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sandy turned red, and then burst out into
a confused laugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! I only said I was <i>thinking</i> of doing
something like that, you know,&#8221; he declared;
&#8220;but that is as far as it would go, I give you
my word, Bob. Whenever I catch myself wanting
to jump at things so, I remember what
Pat said that day we saw the big stag standing
knee deep in the water. Too much hurry, too
sudden a move, spoils many a good game. And
I guess it&#8217;s so. I&#8217;m trying as hard as I know
how to think twice, now, before doing anything.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That sounds more like you, Sandy, and I&#8217;m<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
glad to hear you talk so,&#8221; continued Bob; &#8220;but
did father say anything about how we were to
hunt this afternoon?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is only one thing he insisted on,&#8221;
the other started to reply, when Bob interrupted
him by saying:</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I can guess what that was; we
must take some one along with us; and of
course we&#8217;ll be only too glad to do it, since it
will be Pat O&#8217;Mara, who knows more about
hunting, and Indian fighting, and taking all fur-bearing
animals in traps and snares, than any
three others on board.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just what he said, I declare! Seems like
you must have been close enough to hear it
all!&#8221; exclaimed Sandy, as if surprised; &#8220;and
yet that couldn&#8217;t be, either, for I saw you sitting
here all the time I was speaking with
father. But I&#8217;m glad it&#8217;s settled. And I do
hope we run across plenty of excitement. It
is getting what I call dull, with so little happening.&#8221;</p>

<p>To Bob there was so much to see in the new
pictures presented with every bend of the winding
river, that he never found the time drag on
his hands; but then Sandy was made up
along different lines, and could not remain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
quiet any length, of time without getting nervous.</p>

<p>The time passed slowly, indeed, until they
heard the order given to edge the boat in
toward the southern shore of the river, so that
they could observe it more closely, in order to
make sure that enemies were not lurking in
the undergrowth.</p>

<p>Pat O&#8217;Mara gave it as his opinion that there
seemed to be no evidence that the Indians were
near by; and, as he, too, wanted to stretch his
legs by a little side hunt, it was finally determined
to land.</p>

<p>Of course, there must be more or less danger
in leaving the protection of the strong cabin
of the flatboat, and venturing into the depths
of the forest; but, as has been said before, the
life of a pioneer is so made up of taking risks
that he assumes chances without much thought
or anxiety. When the danger came along they
would trust to their ability to take care of themselves.
And every one of the party felt pretty
much the same way.</p>

<p>Mr. Armstrong had a crude chart of the
river, but it was founded on almost guesswork,
so little was the region to the westward known
at the time. The place where Cincinnati now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
stands was called Fort Washington; and, an
indefinite distance further down, another mark
on the map showed where Harrodsburg stood,
about where the city of Louisville can be found
to-day, marking the falls of the Ohio during
low water times.</p>

<p>So, apparently, the early settlers had a
pretty good eye for the most advantageous natural
sites, upon which to found the white man&#8217;s
cities of the future.</p>

<p>What lay beyond Harrodsburg no one really
knew. Somewhere, in some manner, the Ohio
joined forces with the mighty Mississippi; and
this bold little company of men and women
were on the way to learn the truth, taking their
lives in their hands in so doing.</p>

<p>When the boat had been tied up, Pat and
the two boys started into the woods, bent upon
bringing back fresh meat if it could be procured
by any means in their power.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure,&#8221; remarked the trapper, when they
found themselves out of sight of the river, and
surrounded by the primeval forest, &#8220;we must
be afther kapin&#8217; clost enough till each ither
to hear a signal whistle. If wees do be afther
catchin&#8217; that same, it wull mane to come tegither
as quickly as yees can. But only a cooie<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
stands for &#8216;all&#8217;s well, kape on a-huntin&#8217; right
along wid yees, an&#8217; may the bist man win.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>When they divided their forces, so as to
cover more territory, Pat was wise enough to
station himself midway between the brothers.
Here he could keep in touch with either Sandy
or Bob, a different sort of call meaning that
he wanted a response from the one it designated,
and about whom he might be getting a
trifle anxious.</p>

<p>Pat had hunted many a time with such old
frontiersmen as Jo Davies, John Hardin and
Silas Hardin. He knew pretty much all there
was to be learned about the ways of the cunning
woods folks, from the little mink up to
the great buffalo that, if angered or wounded,
would come charging full at the hunter, ready
to use his wicked short horns in hurling him
many feet into the air, or grinding him into
the earth, if he were so unlucky as to be caught
napping.</p>

<p>No small game would do for them now.
Birds might flush from the thickets and offer
splendid pot shots; but they had agreed not
to think of taking advantage of anything in the
feathered line short of a big wild turkey. And,
with so many mouths to feed, Sandy was more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
inclined to wish they might rout a buffalo out
of some thicket, than anything else.</p>

<p>They advanced for some time, without seeing
anything that offered a chance for a shot, and
Sandy, of course, always impatient, began to
think they might, after all, be compelled to
return to the boat without any fresh meat,
which would be a great pity, since every one
yearned so for a feast.</p>

<p>The afternoon was now waning, and they
found themselves some distance away from the
place where the camp had been made. About
this time Pat called the boys to him for a little
consultation. He believed that, by altering
their course, so as to come upon the river about
two miles below the spot where their friends
were tied up, the prospects for game would be
vastly improved, because the country looked
better to his eyes in that quarter.</p>

<p>So the change in direction was made. Bob
was just as well satisfied, because he did not
much like the idea of keeping on heading
deeper and deeper into the great hills that lay
back from the river, and which doubtless held
more than one village of the hostile red men.</p>

<p>He noticed with some concern that it was
even now beginning to grow a little dusk under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
the tall trees that lifted their lofty heads almost
a full hundred feet in the air. And then,
just when Bob was wondering if they were to
arrive at the river, which could not be more
than a quarter of a mile distant, without one
single sign of game, he heard the well-known
crash of Sandy&#8217;s gun away over to the left;
because Pat carried one of those long-barrelled
rifles, with the small bore, that took a patched
bullet&mdash;one that was enclosed in a greased
piece of linen&mdash;and made a sharp report entirely
different from that of a musket.</p>

<p>Hurrying that way, he found Pat and Sandy
bending over a noble young two-pronged buck
that had jumped from a thicket where he had
been lying, and fallen when the young Nimrod
hastily let fly; for Sandy was a clever all-around
shot.</p>

<p>Pat set to work, assisted by both the boys,
to skin the game, and secure all the edible portions.
These parts were made up into three
packs, so that each might carry a share of the
burden to camp, which was at least two miles
distant.</p>

<p>Wondering whether the shot had reached the
ears of their friends, and picturing their delight
when they sighted all that fine fresh meat,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
the three were trudging along through the
gathering darkness, when, without warning,
Pat stumbled, having evidently caught his foot
in some trailing vine which he had not seen.</p>

<p>Bob hastened to drop his own burden, and
bend over to assist Pat to rise, for he saw that
the other seemed to be having some difficulty
about doing so. When he heard the trapper
groan, Bob&#8217;s alarm increased.</p>

<p>&#8220;What has happened to you, Pat?&#8221; asked
Sandy, who did not yet understand the cause
of the delay, save that their companion had
tripped.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bad cess to the thing; but I&#8217;m afther belavin&#8217;
that I&#8217;ve gone an&#8217; twisted me ankle so
bad that &#8217;tis mesilf that can&#8217;t put the same to
the ground; and that manes a long time before
we say camp agin, so it do,&#8221; grumbled the trapper.</p>

<p>Somehow Bob began to feel a little anxiety,
as though he scented new difficulties looming
up ahead.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI<br />

<small>THE FIGURES AGAINST THE SKY</small></h2>


<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">This</span> is what I call hard luck,&#8221; remarked
Sandy, as he dropped his bundle of deer meat
close to where the trapper sat upon the ground,
rubbing his ankle.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is that same, by the token,&#8221; grumbled
Pat. &#8220;Av yees give me a hand, byes, it&#8217;s
mesilf will thry to sthand up, and say how well
I can walk.&#8221;</p>

<p>Willingly each of the lads took hold of an
arm, and assisted him to gain an upright position;
but, when Pat started bravely to walk,
he made a sorry mess of it. He was a game
fellow, however, and would not be dismayed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure, it may pass away afther I&#8217;ve given
the ould thing a little exercise, like, and av
yees say the worrd we&#8217;ll pick up our packs and
do be goin&#8217; on our way, rejoicin&#8217; becase it&#8217;s
no worrse. What if I&#8217;d broke me nick&mdash;that
would have been a nice pickle for a man to be
in!&#8221;</p>

<p>He even insisted on carrying his share of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
venison, though Bob protested; but Pat was a
stubborn man.</p>

<p>&#8220;Think av all the mouths to be fed, would
ye; and why should I lit it lay here, where it
wull do no good at all, at all, save to fill the
stomach av a wolf, or make a wildcat feel
happy? Sure it goes along wid me if I can
limp.&#8221;</p>

<p>And it did,&mdash;that is, for some little time,
though Pat had to call for a stop, and rest,
every hundred yards. Once he proposed that
the two boys desert him, and make for the place
where the boat was tied up above.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis only a matter av a mile or so, me
lads,&#8221; he said, &#8220;an&#8217; I&#8217;m dead sure ye&#8217;d be
able to find the same widout much throuble.
In good time Pat would come limpin&#8217; into camp.
Kape the river on your lift, that do be all yees
have to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s something we&#8217;ll never do, Pat,
desert a comrade in trouble,&#8221; was the vehement
reply of Bob; and Sandy was even more emphatic;
so the pleased Irish trapper had to
be content with the way things were going.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve got the whole night before us,&#8221; Bob
remarked, in a low voice, for Pat had warned
them to be careful, because there was no telling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
what might be abroad in the big timber bordering
the river.</p>

<p>&#8220;And once we get aboard the flatboat,&#8221; continued
Sandy, in the same vein, &#8220;Pat can have
his sprain looked after by mother; and there&#8217;s
no need of him setting his weight on that foot
again till it&#8217;s well.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was at one of the resting spells that something
occurred to Bob.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was thinking,&#8221; he remarked in a whisper,
&#8220;that, if we looked around, we might find some
good stuff here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Stuff for what?&#8221; asked Sandy.</p>

<p>&#8220;To make a litter out of,&#8221; replied Bob.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! you mean so that we could carry Pat
between us, and the venison, too,&#8221; Sandy whispered
back.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, what do you think of it, Sandy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Seems like a good idea to me; and, if you
say the word, I&#8217;ll begin to look about here
right now, Bob,&#8221; the other answered.</p>

<p>He was about to make the first move when
Pat, who had been listening, broke in upon the
conversation of the brothers.</p>

<p>&#8220;A litter is it that yees would be afther
makin&#8217;,&#8221; he remarked, quickly; &#8220;and to kerry
me to camp like I was a dead soldier, so it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
be? Wull, I&#8217;ve no objections to ye makin&#8217; wan
av the same to kerry the mate; but, by me faith,
ye&#8217;ll niver get Pat O&#8217;Mara to rist his bones
on that litter unless he is out av his mind. An&#8217;
av ye be falin&#8217; like another spell, lit&#8217;s be
away.&#8221;</p>

<p>Of course, after that Bob could not insist,
for only too well did he know the independent
spirit of the Irish trapper. As long as Pat
could put one foot to the ground he would persist
in moving along; nor could Bob prevail
on him to either throw his burden away, or
divide it up between the other two.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll do me share av the worrk, or know the
rason why,&#8221; Pat would answer back, every
time the idea was mentioned; and, as long as
he showed this obstinate streak, they could do
nothing but let him have his way.</p>

<p>Bob was keeping his wits about him all this
while. He noticed the direction they were
taking, and could even give a pretty fair guess
as to the distance yet to be traversed before
they could hope to reach the tied-up boat.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe we are more than a single
mile away from them now; is that so, Pat?&#8221;
he asked, as they sat there, resting again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure, ye do be a smart lad, Bob,&#8221; replied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
the other, in his usual whisper, which the boys
had come to imitate, though it gave a very
mysterious air to their surroundings; &#8220;and,
av I do know annything at all, that&#8217;s about the
distance we sthill have to cover. But don&#8217;t
be worryin&#8217; about me; for I tell yees I can
make it by hook or by crook. It ain&#8217;t often
as Pat O&#8217;Mara&mdash;whist, he sthill now, both av
yees!&#8221;</p>

<p>Bob felt a sudden thrill as the Irish trapper
finished his sentence in this surprising manner.
He knew what it must mean only too well.
Pat had keen ears, even as he also possessed
the eyes of a hawk. His long life in the woods
had made him the equal of a redskin in these
respects, as well as many others pertaining to
following a faint trail, reading signs from the
track of a wild animal, big or small, and such
tricks as Indians know from boyhood.</p>

<p>It was plainly evident from his manner that
he had either seen or heard something suspicious,
and, under the circumstances, this could
only mean hostile Indians.</p>

<p>Bob saw that the other was looking away
toward the left, which was where the river must
lie, for it had been their intention, after striking
the water, to try to follow up the shore,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
hoping to take advantage of the shallow strip
of open that often lay between the margin of
the river and the dense woods.</p>

<p>At the moment they happened to be down
in a sort of shallow gully. A low ridge arose
between the spot where they rested and the
river. The moon was very nearly half full
and, where the great trees did not shut out the
light, it was easy to see the top of this small
ridge, for it happened to be bald in places.</p>

<p>Pat was staring straight upward toward one
of these open spots; and Bob naturally allowed
his eyes to travel in the same quarter. He
heard Sandy give a low gasp; nor did Bob
blame his brother in the least for thus allowing
an indication of his astonishment and dismay
to escape him.</p>

<p>For against the clear sky, plainly outlined
in the moonlight, there was a figure, walking
swiftly along the ridge, and heading up the
river. There was no need for any one to explain
what those feathers stuck in the scalplock
meant, for Bob knew he was looking upon an
Indian in his war dress. Doubtless, had he
been closer, the paint that was daubed upon
his cheeks and forehead could have been seen.
Even the gun he carried, undoubtedly purchased<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
by a bundle of rich furs from the French
traders of the Mississippi posts, could be seen,
as he picked his way across the little gap in
the dark intervening forest, and then vanished
beyond.</p>

<p>But already a second warrior had come into
view, following closely in the footsteps of the
leading brave, it seemed. He, too, was decked
out for war, if those feathers that stood upright
signified all the boys believed they did,
and a gun was clasped in his hand, just as with
the first dark spectre.</p>

<p>A third was in view even before the second
had passed beyond the limits of the watchers&#8217;
vision. A fourth came trailing along, then a
fifth; and the grim procession continued to
move along like a column of nightmare ghosts,
until Bob had unconsciously counted twenty-two
of the savages.</p>

<p>What a narrow escape they had had! Suppose
either he or Sandy had been unwise
enough to talk beyond the whisper which cautious
Pat instituted as the margin of safety,
what chance would they have had against such
a host of cruel foes?</p>

<p>They waited for a minute or so, fearful lest
there might be a straggler who had fallen a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
little distance behind the rest; but, when none
appeared, Bob felt safe in speaking in the
guarded tone used before.</p>

<p>&#8220;That was a close shave, now, I&#8217;m telling
you,&#8221; he said, drawing a long breath. &#8220;If
we&#8217;d been moving at the time, I&#8217;m afraid
they&#8217;d have discovered us long before we did
them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yis,&#8221; grumbled Pat, &#8220;wid me makin&#8217; all
the noise av a granehorn in the woods, a-draggin&#8217;
me lift lig afther me. But sure, that&#8217;s not
the worrst av it, byes. Did ye not notice the
direction the bog trotters do be goin&#8217;?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Up the river!&#8221; said Sandy, quickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;And the flatboat lies there, not more than
a mile away!&#8221; gasped Bob, feeling suddenly
cold all over, as a spasm of dread took possession
of him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! how can we warn them?&#8221; asked
Sandy, getting to his feet, as though sorely
tempted to start on a run for the river, so that
he could try to make the camp before the murderous
Indians reached it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Whist! be aisy now, and we&#8217;ll thry and
find some way to do the same,&#8221; remarked Pat,
as he painfully arose, and made ready to clutch
hold of the impetuous lad, if there was any sign<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
that Sandy really contemplated giving them
the slip.</p>

<p>&#8220;But something ought to be done at once,&#8221;
remonstrated the other, his voice filled with
emotion, as he thought of the loved ones who
might be caught unawares by the savages and
fall victims to their cruel tomahawks and
knives. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you think either Bob or myself
might get there ahead of them, if we went
along the edge of the river? Please, Pat, think
quick now, if ever you did in all your life.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis that same I&#8217;m doin&#8217;, me bye,&#8221; the
trapper replied. &#8220;Ye must pull up, and
howld yer horses. &#8217;Tis a time to do the right
thing, or be the same token ye&#8217;re apt to ruin
the whole business. Just stop and remimber
that afore we lift camp I arranged all that wid
yer father.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The signals, you mean, Pat?&#8221; asked
Sandy, while Bob gulped down the lump in his
throat that had threatened to choke him, for
a sudden sense of relief had come to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;The same, Sandy,&#8221; the trapper replied,
laying a kindly hand on the arm of the excited
boy. &#8220;Rist aisy now, would ye, for we have
it in our power to sind warmin&#8217; to lit thim
know danger hangs over the camp; and that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
they must git aboord, and cut loose down the
strame widout delay. But, befoore we sind
that warrnin&#8217;, &#8217;tis only the parrt av wisdom,
do ye say, to lit the inimy cover more ground,
so that we do be havin&#8217; a chanct to make our
iscape, in case they sind back a parrt av their
number to look us up.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sandy, after all, could be reasonable, once he
grasped the breadth of a plan, and he hastened
to declare his reliance on the shrewdness of the
Irish trapper.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re right, Pat,&#8221; he said, huskily; &#8220;but
oh! don&#8217;t wait too long; make it soon!&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII<br />

<small>SIGNAL SHOTS</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">How</span> those seconds dragged, to the two impatient
boys! They seemed, each one, to be
hours in length, so eager were the lads to send
the warning.</p>

<p>But Pat, who kept quite cool, knew what he
was doing. He was also well aware of the fact
that, in their eagerness to save the others, the
boys would not take any precaution with reference
to themselves; and, as a consequence,
must fall victims to the fury of the baffled savages.</p>

<p>Pat&#8217;s idea was to save both parties; and this
was why he meant to allow a certain amount
of time to elapse before informing those at the
boat of the impending peril, which they could
only avoid by immediate flight.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, lit us be thryin&#8217; to cross the ridge,
me byes,&#8221; said Pat, picking up his bundle of
meat with the old-time obstinacy that would
not give in.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;The ridge!&#8221; echoed Sandy, in dismay, as
he fell in behind, when they had started.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure, we have to git beyant the same, av
we hope to make the river,&#8221; the Irish trapper
went on to say.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then do you hope to follow up the water,
and get there ahead of them?&#8221; gasped the boy,
in sore distress, as he contemplated the slow
progress the limping man was making at the
time.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not, be the same token,&#8221; answered
Pat; &#8220;but the closer we are to the river, the
better for us, when we do be thryin&#8217; to work
down strame, afther warrnin&#8217; the camp, d&#8217;ye
mind.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! I see now what you mean,&#8221; Sandy
whispered, keeping close behind the other.
&#8220;After we&#8217;ve sent the signal, we must hurry
as fast as we can down the river, so as to put
a lot of distance between us. Then, when the
boat comes along, we have to hail them, and
wade out to get aboard. Is that what you figure
on, Pat?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yees have hit the tarrget in the bull&#8217;s-eye,
Sandy; and now, arrah, please close up shop;
it do be harrd climbin&#8217; the ridge, and we nade
ivery bit av breath to kerry us over the same.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>

<p>Under ordinary conditions the task would
not have given them much trouble; but bearing
such heavy burdens, and with Pat able to
make such poor headway, it took them some
little time to gain the top of the ridge.</p>

<p>Bob fancied that they must be about in the
same spot as where they had seen the grim line
of fighting men outlined against the sky. He
hoped there would be no one below to notice
their passage at the time.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do we fire the shots from here!&#8221; asked
Sandy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not yit,&#8221; replied the trapper; &#8220;we must
git down near the river first. Depind on it,
there do be plenty av time yit. The hathen
wud crape along, afther gettin&#8217; above, and I&#8217;m
thinkin&#8217; it might be all av half an hour afore
they could rach the camp. Long afore thin
we&#8217;ll have our frinds a-sailin&#8217; down the river
as nice as pie. Lave it to me, byes, and I do
promise ye all will be well.&#8221;</p>

<p>And so Sandy had to repress his desire to
yell, or fire his gun, or do something rash, in
the hope of sending the alarm all the way over
that mile of territory, so as to start the people
on the flatboat down the river.</p>

<p>They had less trouble in descending, though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
Pat grunted considerably as he frequently
wrenched that lame ankle, in his efforts to
walk. They could see the river shining in the
light of the moon, when openings occurred in
the trees. It seemed to have the appearance
of an old friend. And how glad they would
be when they glimpsed the boat moving along
with the current, and a safe distance from the
dangerous shore.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, I think it be time,&#8221; said Pat, presently,
when they had gained a spot at least
half-way down the side of the bluff.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell us what we are to do, Pat,&#8221; remarked
Bob, as he deposited his share of the venison
on the ground, and took his gun in both hands.</p>

<p>Sandy was already prepared to carry out
his share of the programme; for he always
did things with great rapidity.</p>

<p>&#8220;The arrangemint was this,&#8221; said the trapper,
impressively. &#8220;Three shots, aich about
five seconds afther the wan afoore. Thin wait
a minute or so, till we could reload our guns,
whin the same thing was to be done agin. That
winds up the performance. Are yees riddy?&#8221;</p>

<p>Both boys answered in the affirmative.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thin, Sandy, do ye fire first; and Bob,
whin I say the worrd, lit fly. As for mesilf,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
I&#8217;ll wind up the first relay in great style. Go
it, Sandy!&#8221;</p>

<p>Instantly the boy raised his gun, and pulled
the trigger. There was a loud report, for
those old-fashioned flint-lock muskets held a
large charge of powder, and the wad was usually
well rammed before the bullet followed it
home.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, Bob!&#8221; and hardly had the words
been spoken by the trapper than the second
report rang out.</p>

<p>Sandy was already feverishly reloading,
when Pat followed with a third shot.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder what the Indians will think when
they hear that volley?&#8221; Bob remarked.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s going to puzzle them a lot to make it
out,&#8221; Sandy declared. &#8220;But what if those at
the boat shouldn&#8217;t hear our signal, Pat?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There do be no danger at all av that, son,&#8221;
replied the trapper, readily. &#8220;Becase we did
not turrn up be darrk, they are likely listenin&#8217;
for signs. And, av yees notice, the night wind
is crapin&#8217; up the river, comin&#8217; from the west;
so that the sound av the guns was kerried
straight away to the camp. Ready, Sandy?
Thin let fly!&#8221;</p>

<p>Once again was the programme carried out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
as before, the three shots punctuating the stillness
of the night.</p>

<p>&#8220;And now &#8217;tis away we go, headin&#8217; for the
idge av the river,&#8221; said Pat, again shouldering
that prized venison, which, if once taken safely
on board the boat, would be well earned, indeed.</p>

<p>They soon came to the bank of the river,
and just as had been expected, found that the
walking was better if they kept close to the
water&#8217;s edge. In places they might have to
push through some dense copse that persisted
in growing to the water&#8217;s edge; but, on the
whole, it proved to be a wise move.</p>

<p>Of course they headed down-stream. This
was done in order to put as great a distance
as possible between the Indians and themselves;
for later on they hoped to have an
opportunity to get aboard the flatboat; and
it meant a good deal to them all if the enemy
at that time happened to be some distance
away.</p>

<p>All the while the boys were anxiously listening
for sounds from the rear. Naturally they
were picturing all sorts of terrible things as
happening to the crew and passengers of the
floating home on the water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>

<p>And, when suddenly a series of fierce yells
broke out, Sandy and Bob stopped in their
tracks, shivering with fear.</p>

<p>Pat, however, only chuckled. He could read
between the lines, and hence knew the true
meaning of those loud cries.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure they do be as mad as a wit hin,&#8221; he
remarked, as a number of gunshots came to
their ears, still accompanied by those shouts.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you think our friends have escaped,
do you, Pat?&#8221; inquired Sandy, eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do be sure av the same,&#8221; was the prompt
answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;But listen to the firing that is going on!&#8221;
Sandy continued.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is all on the wan side, I warrant ye,
lad,&#8221; the trapper declared, with firm conviction
in his manner.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, for I know the sound of those hateful
French guns. They do not make the same
kind of report as our own weapons,&#8221; Bob ventured
to say. &#8220;And that means the Indians
are just firing away at the floating boat, to give
vent to their fury because their prey has escaped.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What if they follow the boat down the
river, and come on us when we are trying to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
get aboard?&#8221; his brother asked, still seeing
trouble ahead.</p>

<p>&#8220;To be sure, there might be a chanct av the
same happenin&#8217;,&#8221; Pat admitted; &#8220;but we&#8217;ll
have to risk it, I fear, lads. Av we can only
get to that point av land ye say below there,
it would be a great place to step aboord, becase
the boat must pass close by it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And for the same reason the Indians are
likely to think of it, and hurry here, in hopes
of getting the same chance,&#8221; remarked Bob.</p>

<p>But all the same, he knew that Pat had
planned wisely. There was really nothing else
for them to do, unless they wished to allow the
boat to pass on down-stream, and wait for them
far below. That would necessitate the making
of a temporary raft out of some big log, and
floating down to rejoin their friends.</p>

<p>The lame trapper hurried as much as he
could, utterly regardless of the pain the effort
caused him, and in this way they presently
reached the point of land that thrust out into
the river.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps they&#8217;ve already gone by?&#8221; suggested
Sandy, when they failed to see anything
of the floating house above their hiding-place.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;I hardly think there&#8217;s been time for that,&#8221;
Bob replied. &#8220;The current is only about four
miles an hour, Pat told us; and, unless my
figuring is wrong, it would take them nearly
half an hour to get past here. And we have
been no such time making this point; have we,
Pat?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis right yees are, me bye,&#8221; replied the
trapper; and he did not say more, for he was
scanning the surface of the river as well as he
was able.</p>

<p>&#8220;But it seems to me there&#8217;s a river fog
coming up from below,&#8221; declared Sandy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, that&#8217;s a fact,&#8221; admitted Bob; &#8220;I
noticed that myself; but it isn&#8217;t going to be
so thick we couldn&#8217;t see the flatboat passing
anywhere this side of the middle of the
stream.&#8221;</p>

<p>All relapsed into silence. The deepest anxiety
prevailed, for it meant a tremendous lot
to the three wanderers if they should be so
unfortunate as to miss the boat, and be thrown
on their own resources, with a lame comrade
on their hands in the bargain.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you see anything, Bob?&#8221; whispered
Sandy, presently, when the silence began to
seem unbearable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;I believe I do,&#8221; came the reply. &#8220;There,
Pat has caught it, too; for I can tell from his
actions. Yes, it&#8217;s a moving object away up
yonder; and I do believe, Sandy, it is the boat,
coming at last!&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII<br />

<small>THE MAN WITH THE CHARMED LIFE</small></h2>


<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">How</span> can we let them know we&#8217;re here, so
they&#8217;ll push in close enough, and anchor, while
some one comes for us in the dugout?&#8221; Sandy
inquired.</p>

<p>Pat had prepared for that, too, it seemed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m to flash a bit av powder to till them
we&#8217;re waitin&#8217; beyant the p&#8217;int av land,&#8221; he
remarked; &#8220;and &#8217;tis mesilf as had better be
gettin&#8217; ready to do the same in a hurry, for
they do be comin&#8217; along right fast.&#8221;</p>

<p>He placed a small amount of the precious
powder on a stone, and then held his flint and
steel in readiness until such time as the boat
came close enough to suit his purpose.</p>

<p>Then it was no effort for the experienced
trapper to send a spark into the little pile of
powder, which went off instantly, giving a brief
but vivid flash.</p>

<p>All eyes were on the advancing flatboat, for
it was a matter of importance to them to know
whether the signal had been seen or not.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;There, they know we are here, and want
to get aboard!&#8221; exclaimed Sandy, as a single
shot came from the deck of the boat.</p>

<p>&#8220;If any of the Indians were on the watch,
and saw the flash of powder, as well as the
gunshot, they might give a guess what we were
up to,&#8221; Bob remarked.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll hope, then, they gave up chasing
after the boat, when they saw it was no use,&#8221;
Sandy added.</p>

<p>The flatboat was now close by, and they could
even see moving figures on the deck. The two
boys felt positive that among them were their
anxious parents; and the fact made them all
the more eager to get safely aboard.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now they&#8217;re going to anchor!&#8221; declared
Sandy; &#8220;and I can see somebody dropping
back into the dugout that trails astern. Let&#8217;s
get ready to put our meat aboard, and follow
with ourselves.&#8221;</p>

<p>Immediately the small boat started straight
for the end of the tongue of land, as though
the paddler knew that those he sought were apt
to be close by that point. Still grunting with
his painful ankle, Pat insisted on picking up
his share of the venison, with which he limped
forward.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>

<p>It was Mr. Armstrong himself who came in
the dugout. So eager was he to make sure that
both his boys were safe, that he would not let
any one else attempt this part of the rescue
work.</p>

<p>Sandy started to tell what had happened, but
Bob stopped all talk, and urged him to get in
the boat without a second&#8217;s delay, after all the
venison, together with the lame trapper, had
been deposited there.</p>

<p>There would be plenty of time for explanations
later on, when danger did not hang so
heavily over their heads.</p>

<p>With all his might Mr. Armstrong urged the
little craft, now really overloaded, out toward
the anchored flatboat. At any second Bob expected
to hear the shout of a coming brave, and
perhaps have the report of a gun break upon
his ear. Until they had clambered aboard the
larger craft, he did not feel that they could
call themselves safe.</p>

<p>But when finally every one of them had
climbed over the side, both Sandy and Bob felt
like giving a shout of thanksgiving.</p>

<p>They were met by the fond arms of their
mother, and pressed to her heart; for no one
knew all that she must have suffered after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
hearing those terribly significant six shots, telling
them cruel foes were abroad, and that they
must apparently abandon the three who were
ashore.</p>

<p>The anchor had hardly been raised than
one of the men reported seeing shadowy figures
flitting along the tongue of land; but as
the unwieldy craft again commenced to pass
down with the current, and they knew that once
more the foe had been left in the lurch, those
on board gave free rein to their joy in loud
cheers.</p>

<p>A few disappointed yells announced that
they had not passed on any too soon; and the
boys decided that they had great reason to be
thankful over their narrow escape.</p>

<p>And later on, when the dearly-won venison
was lifted out of the dugout that trailed astern,
the thought of having fresh meat gave them
all much satisfaction.</p>

<p>Of course the boys had to tell their story
over and over again, while many questions
were asked regarding the coming of the Indians.</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you think they knew we were
there?&#8221; asked Mr. Harkness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pat says a brave must have sighted the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
boat, and followed it until we came to land,&#8221;
remarked Bob. &#8220;Then he hastened to his village,
which may be back here a few miles, and
a war party was hurriedly made up. Only for
our discovering them as they passed along that
ridge, the end might not be so nice as it is.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was determined that their best course
would be to put boldly across the river, and
pass down the northern shore. This could be
accomplished by means of the big sweeps; and
already several of the men were working them.</p>

<p>An hour or two later they were in touch with
the northern side of the stream; and, as the
moon began to show signs of setting, they
determined to anchor, as the recent scare had
taken away all desire to tie up to the shore.</p>

<p>There was no further trouble that night, and
another morning found them in high spirits.
Pat&#8217;s sprain still bothered him, more or less,
and would for some days to come; but Mrs.
Armstrong had bound some of her wonderful
healing salve upon the swollen ankle, and the
trapper declared he was doing much better
than he had even hoped would be the case.</p>

<p>A day of peace followed. They drifted along
not a great distance from the shore, and yet
keeping away from any dangerous points,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
where enemies might be in hiding, bent on getting
a shot at the white voyagers.</p>

<p>Sandy did more or less fishing as they went,
and had some success, though he found it better
to delay his best efforts until they were tied
up for the night. As for Bob, he noticed that
there were still flocks of wild fowl on the river
at various points, and, longing to bag a few,
he awaited his time, when a shot was apt to
count, and then showed what a good marksman
he was.</p>

<p>Altogether they were doing splendidly, and
had little cause for complaint when night closed
in around them. They tied up this time, for
there had been no sign of Indians the livelong
day, and, as Pat was in no condition to scout
around, one of the men volunteered to take his
place. When he came in later, he declared that,
so far as he could discover, there was not an
enemy within ten miles of them.</p>

<p>That night passed without any alarm, for
which all of them felt very thankful, since they
had lost considerable sleep the night before;
and it seemed like old times to be able to repose
in comfort, only arousing to take a turn
at sentry duty, according to the routine arranged.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<p>The next day was really a repetition of that
peaceful one. Sandy declared that he thought
all the bad Indians must be on the Kentucky
side of the Ohio, and that, if they were wise,
they would remain on the northern shore from
that time on; but Pat gave him to understand
that it was six of one and half a dozen of the
other, since marauding bands were constantly
on the move, visiting between villages, or joining
forces for a raid against the settlements of
the hated palefaces.</p>

<p>It was about the middle of the afternoon
when one of the men declared that he felt sure
he had heard the distant report of firearms,
and what seemed to be faint yells, from some
point down the river.</p>

<p>Of course this excited everybody aboard the
flatboat, from the oldest man down to the children,
who were of an age to appreciate the
perils by which they were constantly surrounded.</p>

<p>Some little time afterwards there was a cry
raised that a man had been seen running over
an elevation on the shore, and hotly pursued,
it seemed, by the Indians.</p>

<p>Mr. Armstrong, realizing that perhaps another
crisis was impending, ordered that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
women and children should remain in the shelter
of the cabin, while the rest crouched on
deck, awaiting the turn of events.</p>

<p>&#8220;I see him now!&#8221; cried Sandy; &#8220;and, sure
enough, he&#8217;s pushing for the river as fast as
his legs will carry him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And there come the savages chasing after
him,&#8221; declared Bob. &#8220;There, now one stops,
and sends an arrow, while another fires his
gun; but he still runs on, and I do not think
they could have hit him, because he keeps dodging
this way and that all the time, to make them
miss.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Begorra, now, p&#8217;raps they don&#8217;t be afther
wantin&#8217; to hit him,&#8221; suggested Pat, who
was with the others, watching the stirring
scene.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! he means that this may only be another
trick of the Indians, meant to get us to
draw in closer, so that the rest, who are hidden
among the bushes, can pour in a volley, and
then rush the boat,&#8221; Sandy burst out.</p>

<p>&#8220;And this time, make yer mind up,&#8221; said
Pat, grimly, &#8220;av I have rason to belave the
omadhaun is only a turncoat a-tryin&#8217; to lure
us in to be kilt, I&#8217;ve a good mind to knock him
over, as he desarves.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d go very slow about that, Pat,&#8221; advised
Mr. Armstrong.</p>

<p>&#8220;For what would ye be sayin&#8217; the likes av
that, sor?&#8221; asked the trapper, moving his
long-barrelled rifle up a little further, as though
eager to begin operations right away.</p>

<p>&#8220;You can see that he&#8217;s jumped into the
water now, and is wading boldly out, as though
he meant to swim out to us when we come along.
There, he stands up to his middle in the river,
and levels his rifle. Did you see that savage
fall when he fired? Does that look as if he
was a renegade, Pat?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Arrah! if we only <i>knew</i> that the hathan
were kilt, I&#8217;d belave ye, sor; but they do be
sindin&#8217; in a hape of shots in return; and look
at the water splash around his head as he
swims away. Some of the balls do be strikin&#8217;
mighty clost, it sames to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, too close to be fired at a friend and
ally,&#8221; Mr. Armstrong went on; &#8220;and I am
positive they were meant to bring him down.
There, he shakes his fist at them now, and
laughs, as though he did not know the meaning
of the word fear.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It seems to me I have heard that laugh
before,&#8221; exclaimed Sandy, eagerly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;Right ye are, laddy,&#8221; said Pat, suddenly
rousing himself, and lowering his gun.</p>

<p>Mr. Armstrong was leaning forward, and
surveying the swimmer closely, as though he,
too, had detected certain familiar features in
connection with the party.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll always be glad you didn&#8217;t fire so
hastily, Pat,&#8221; he declared; &#8220;for upon my
word I do believe yonder man who acts as
though he were determined to come aboard our
craft is none other than our friend, Simon
Kenton, the borderer, who mocks the efforts of
the Indians to finish him, and has been held
a prisoner, doomed to the stake, more times
than any man along the Ohio!&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX<br />

<small>KENTON, THE RECKLESS BORDERER</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> swimmer had timed himself so as to
reach the side of the flatboat as it swung past;
and, in order to create a diversion in his favor,
Pat called on his friends to send in a hot fire
among the charging Indians.</p>

<p>This had the effect of making them scamper
for shelter; and meanwhile Kenton managed
to get on the other side of the floating craft.
Eager hands were outstretched to assist him
over the side. He was still laughing, as though
he considered the whole thing a joke. And the
very first thing he did upon reaching the deck
of the boat was to shake his fist in the direction
of the hidden foes, and shout some derisive
words in the Shawanee tongue toward them.
(<a id="Note_10r"></a><a href="#Note_10">Note 10.</a>)</p>

<p>They were soon far below the dangerous
spot; and, after Kenton had regained his
breath, he proceeded to explain how it all happened.</p>

<p>He had learned, while hunting with a party<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
of friends, that the Indians over in Kentucky
were once more on the war-path, and that
Boonesborough itself was threatened with extinction.</p>

<p>Faithful to his best friend, Daniel Boone,
Kenton, after trying in vain to coax the other
hunters to join him, had alone started for the
Ohio, meaning to cross over, and make his way
to the scene of action by fast stages.</p>

<p>He had had the misfortune to fall upon a
party of Shawanees, and, after a fierce battle,
was taken prisoner, and carried to their village.</p>

<p>&#8220;But, as usual, they could not hold you,&#8221;
remarked Mr. Armstrong.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! I knew that was what would happen,&#8221;
replied the woodsman, lightly. &#8220;And I managed
to escape in good season, for time was
worth something to me, since my rifle is needed
for the defence of Boonesborough. After I am
refreshed I will only ask you to put me ashore
over yonder,&#8221; and he pointed across the rolling
river, to where lay the hilly shore of the &#8220;Dark
and Bloody Ground,&#8221; as Kentucky was well
called in those early days.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then we must start without delay, and you
shall have a bite to eat before you leave us,&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
said Mr. Armstrong; after which he gave orders
to have the course of the flatboat changed,
heading once more across the river.</p>

<p>The women were soon engaged in preparing
supper, so that Kenton might not be detained
longer than was absolutely necessary, and,
some of the venison having been held over, it
came in very handy for that purpose.</p>

<p>Meantime there was an exchange of stories
between them, Kenton being desirous of learning
why they were here, so far away from the
home in which he had last met them. Thus
he heard about the flood, and the determination
of the settlers making up the party to head
into the west, and seek a new home on the bank
of the wonderful Mississippi.</p>

<p>Of course this sort of pluck appealed to such
a bold nature as that of Simon Kenton. He
told them they were doing the right thing, and
related many facts connected with the Promised
Land, some gleaned from others, and a
few through personal observation on some of
his wanderings, that quite naturally further
strengthened their resolution, which may have
been becoming a little weak in a few of the
party, after their recent trials on the river.</p>

<p>By the time the boat drew near the Kentucky<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
shore supper was ready; so the anchor was
thrown overboard, and the entire company sat
down to enjoy the feast the good wives had
prepared.</p>

<p>If the variety of food was not so extensive,
there was at least enough in quantity and to
spare; and, with the appetites that went with
their life in the open, this was usually the main
thing.</p>

<p>Kenton begged a little more powder and ball
from Mr. Armstrong, and it was only too willingly
given, for they knew that he had a difficult
trail to follow, and they could in imagination
see the dangers that peopled it.</p>

<p>Just as darkness was settling over the land
and water Bob and Sandy took the young borderer
ashore in the dugout, only too proud of
the chance to do him a favor. And Kenton,
having shaken hands with them at parting,
Sandy sighed upon looking after him when he
disappeared among the great trees that lined
the shore.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, get aboard here, Sandy,&#8221; urged his
brother, who knew well what vague thoughts
and ambitions must he flitting through the
other&#8217;s mind just then, because he was aware
of Sandy&#8217;s desire to follow in the footsteps of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
Simon Kenton, who had ever been the hero the
boy admired.</p>

<p>And all the way back to the anchored flatboat
Sandy maintained a grim silence, though
Bob knew it would wear off after a bit, and the
boy become his usual merry self. The truth of
the matter was, Sandy possessed an adventurous
spirit, and chafed under restraint. He
admired the free nature of Kenton, who came
and went as the whim urged him, being under
contract to no man. And then, too, the very
recklessness of the young borderer appealed to
Sandy, who was inclined in that direction himself.</p>

<p>Another quiet night followed, and once more
the voyagers were on their way. It would not
be a great while now before they reached the
small post on the Ohio bank called by the name
of Fort Washington, in honor of the American
soldier who was attracting general attention at
the time, and seemed to be the only Continental
who might lead the armies of the colonists in
case the threatened rupture with the Mother
Country came about.</p>

<p>Again did they cross the river, for knowing
that they would at any time come in sight of
the post, they wanted to be in a position to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
make a landing. Here, safe for a time, they
could rest, having completed the first stage of
their long and hazardous journey to the Mississippi.</p>

<p>It was Sandy who first discovered a flag floating
from a staff, and, although, at the time, the
banner of England was beginning to lose some
of its attractiveness for the colonists, still,
when seen under those conditions, after having
been beset by the savage foe for many days
and nights, they gave it a cheer.</p>

<p>The post had only been recently established,
and, while visited by all wandering hunters
and trappers who roamed the country in search
of game and adventure, there were only a few
families staying there. The arrival of a flatboat
was an event calculated to greatly excite
the garrison of the post, and consequently our
friends received a warm welcome.</p>

<p>It was nice to feel that for a short time at
least they could lie down to sleep without dreading
lest they be aroused by the savage war-whoops
of the cruel foe, always ready to overpower
any daring settler or trapper of the
hated palefaces.</p>

<p>Bob and Sandy were glad to get ashore
again. The latter wished very much for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
chance to take a hunt into the forests that at
this time completely flanked the little station
in the cup between the several hills, and facing
the river; but to this Mr. Armstrong would
not give his consent.</p>

<p>They had learned that the various Indian
tribes were in something of a ferment, with
such leaders as the notorious Pontiac urging
them on to a confederation, the object of which
was to drive out the encroaching white man
from their hunting grounds. And several
times, of late, those who ventured out beyond
the stockade of the new post had been fired
on, showing that crafty enemies lurked near
by all the while, ready to take advantage of
any opportunity to secure a scalp.</p>

<p>Several days passed while they lingered
here, for it was very pleasant, and the adventurous
settlers knew that they would not have
a chance to see their kind again for a long
while.</p>

<p>Coming upon Bob one afternoon, after they
had heard that the start was to be made on
the following morning, Sandy found his brother
looking at some small object which he immediately
recognized.</p>

<p>It was the last piece of curled birch bark,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
on which their unknown friend had written his
message of warning, using the picture language
of the Indian, so universally known throughout
all the tribes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! I had forgotten all about that,&#8221; Sandy
burst out; &#8220;and, now that we&#8217;ve come so far
away from our home up on the Ohio, I suppose
we&#8217;ll never know who sent these friendly warnings,
and just why.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s something I was wondering about,&#8221;
replied Bob. &#8220;Now, here&#8217;s the arrow to which
this message was fastened; and wouldn&#8217;t you
say this one had been made by just the same
cunning hand?&#8221;</p>

<p>He reached behind him, and placed a second
shaft beside the first arrow. Sandy bent his
head to examine them more closely. Then he
looked up again.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean, Bob, and where did
you get that second Delaware arrow?&#8221; he demanded,
quickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where but in the roof of our flatboat
cabin,&#8221; returned the other. &#8220;It had been fired
from up on the hills back yonder, I do believe;
though the marksman must have been a rare
one to hit a target so far away. But it bore
no birch-bark message, though I can well believe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
it was sent just to tell us our strange
friend, who has watched over us so many times,
is still following us down the river, and means
to keep up with us to the end. That Indian,
Sandy, must believe he owes us a heavy debt
of gratitude, and he means to pay it back, some
way or other.&#8221;</p>

<p>And Sandy, handling the feathered shaft,
had a feeling almost of awe steal over him, as
he reflected what gratitude must stand for in
the eyes of an Indian brave. Hundreds of
miles this unknown friend had already travelled,
trying to stand between the boys and
harm; and the end was not yet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! I do hope we know who he is some
of these days,&#8221; the boy said, soberly.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX<br />

<small>THE TWO-LEGGED WOLF</small></h2>


<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">I&#8217;m</span> glad to be afloat once more!&#8221;</p>

<p>Of course that could be no one but Sandy
making such a remark, under the circumstances.
He was leaning over the side of the
bulwark of the flatboat, and looking back up
the river toward Fort Washington.</p>

<p>It was all very nice, stopping with friends
who were interested in their welfare, as all
pioneers must be; but for Sandy delay became
monotonous. He liked action, and plenty of it.</p>

<p>Besides, his ambition to set eyes on that wonderful
river of the west grew in volume, the
further they advanced along their journey. It
was now in the nature of a passion with the
lad. And of course, his father and mother
would never be happy again until they had
selected a location for the new homestead in
the wilderness bordering the Mississippi; so
the sooner they reached their destination the
better Sandy&mdash;yes, and Bob also&mdash;would be
pleased.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p>

<p>Their plans had been talked over so often at
the frontier post that several others manifested
a desire to accompany the four families to the
country they had heard so much about; but,
although Mr. Armstrong declared he would be
only too well pleased to have such a noble addition
to their number, the capacity of the flatboat
had already been reached, so that there
was really no opportunity to stow even one
more family on board.</p>

<p>It was settled, however, that they would
leave some sign of their location, if the opportunity
came about; or, failing that, get word
back to these new friends, so that they too
might build an ark, and float down to the Mississippi
in turn, to join their fortunes with
those of the first adventurous party.</p>

<p>Bob was not far away from his brother when
Sandy made the remark with which this chapter
opens, and he smiled to hear what the younger
lad said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I can understand what you mean,
Sandy,&#8221; he replied, &#8220;for I feel a little that
way myself. But just now I was wondering
where he can be, and how he makes his way
across from one side of the river to the
other?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! now you&#8217;re speaking of the mysterious
Indian who sends those Delaware arrows every
little while, and seems to mean to keep along
with us, just like he was a shadow?&#8221; the other
returned.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hardly that, Sandy,&#8221; said Bob, &#8220;because
you can see a shadow; but never once up to
now have either of us set eyes on this queer
friend who likes to work in secret. Think of
how far away from his village he must have
wandered; and it begins to look as if we might
have him around to protect us even after we
get to our new home down below.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I heard father speaking about another difficulty
we have ahead of us, which is the falls
of the Ohio, down about where Harrodsburg
lies,&#8221; Bob went on presently.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! will we have to abandon our fine flatboat
there, and take up the journey on foot?&#8221;
cried Sandy, to whom the thought of a falls
meant some grand cataract, like the famous
one at Niagara, of which he had heard many
times.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, if there is water enough in the river,
we expect to pass right through; but, if there
seems to be any danger, father says he will
anchor the boat above, and either investigate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
the conditions himself, or find some man who
knows the channel. Hunters and trappers are
used to passing down that way, and shoot
through without bothering themselves about
danger. And we&#8217;ll get along all right, I guess,
Sandy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then the falls aren&#8217;t so very high, after
all?&#8221; asked the other, heaving a sigh of genuine
relief.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! no,&#8221; laughed Bob; &#8220;they are what
some hunters call rapids. At high water you&#8217;d
never know they were there, Pat says. He has
seen the place only once, and never shot them,
so father could hardly depend on him for a
pilot. But you wait and see. We are in too
great luck to get wrecked on the rocks like that.
There will be a way for us to get through.&#8221;</p>

<p>Several days later they saw smoke ashore,
and discovered a party of hunters in camp.
They were a hardy lot, ready to fight Indians
as cheerfully as they were willing to shoot deer
or buffalo.</p>

<p>The flatboat was anchored as close to the
shore as seemed wise, and Mr. Armstrong invited
the others to come out and visit; but they
said they had no boat. One of them Pat immediately
recognized.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;Sure that looks like me ould frind, Jo
Davies,&#8221; he remarked; and the man hearing
what he said, called back:</p>

<p>&#8220;Just who it is, Pat O&#8217;Mara, and glad to
see you again.&#8221;</p>

<p>Thereupon Pat became wild to take the boat
and go ashore after the hunter who had more
than once been in his company when on the
trail, or a trapping expedition.</p>

<p>Of course, by this time Pat&#8217;s lame ankle had
mended so that he could walk about as well
as ever, though for perhaps a whole year he
would have to favor the left foot a little, when
he could.</p>

<p>He brought the four men out with him, and
they spent a couple of hours aboard, asking
for the latest news from the distant sea-coast.</p>

<p>In this far away country news travelled very
slowly; yet evidently these pioneers understood
the conditions existing between the
Crown and the rebellious colonies; for their
first question was whether there had been an
open break as yet.</p>

<p>The moon had come and gone, so that there
was no longer a chance to float down the river
after nightfall, since it would be too dangerous
in the darkness. Accordingly they determined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
to spend the night where they were, supper
being cooked ashore, after the boat had been
urged in by means of the stout poles.</p>

<p>The four hunters remained to partake with
them, and Jo Davies even promised to stay
with the party to see them safely over the falls,
which he said were just below a few miles, and
would be reached early on the morrow. Afterwards,
he would rejoin his companions at a
certain rendezvous; when the bold quartette,
already on their way back from the Mississippi,
where they had been annoying the French trappers
exceedingly, intended setting out for that
region where the settlements founded by Boone
were struggling hard to hold their own against
the savage foe.</p>

<p>Thus they found the needed pilot; for Jo
Davies had been over the ground many times,
so that he knew well the channel that was
safest, between the rocks that might destroy
the boat if an inexperienced hand sought to
show the way.</p>

<p>This undertaking was successfully accomplished
on the next day. The boys were of
course particularly fascinated by the passage
of the falls of the Ohio. Sandy was sorry when
it had been accomplished, and they were safely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
moored to the bank below the dangerous zone.
But as for Bob, he breathed much easier; for
at one time he had feared that they were bound
to strike heavily against a snag that looked
wicked enough to do them considerable damage,
and perhaps bring about a wreck.</p>

<p>But now all was well; and presently, after
they had put their kind friend ashore again,
so that he might rejoin the other three hunters
and hasten to the assistance of their old comrade,
Boone, they could resume the voyage with
no further obstacle in the way worth mentioning.</p>

<p>And now began glorious days for the boys.
They could see the wooded hills of Kentucky
on the left, and the prairie lands of what is now
Indiana and Illinois off to the right, across the
widening river. Crossing over, they even went
ashore at a place where there seemed to be no
danger of an Indian ambush, and here spent
one whole day.</p>

<p>During that time Mr. Armstrong and the
other heads of families showed a keen interest
in the nature of the soil, and the wonderful
growth of flowers and grass that it seemed to
support, all of which pleased them immensely.</p>

<p>Of course Sandy and Bob, being wild for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
another hunt after fresh meat, easily persuaded
their father to let them go forth; and, as before,
Pat accompanied them.</p>

<p>As they had discovered many signs that
showed that buffalo roamed over these prairie
lands, the young hunters were of course eager
to get a chance to shoot one of these animals.
Such splendid quarry would yield a good supply
of fresh meat, and be a change besides from
the jerked venison, of which they were growing
heartily tired.</p>

<p>In this particular Pat&#8217;s previous acquaintance
with the country came into good service.
He knew just where the buffalo were apt to
be found at that time of day, and at the season
of the year, for it was now not far from early
summer.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll be afther takin&#8217; up our way among
thim bunches av trees beyant the knoll yonder,&#8221;
he remarked, leading them forth; &#8220;and
the chances be tin to wan we&#8217;ll say somethin&#8217;
worth while before we come back. Be aisy now,
and walk in Injun file, bendin&#8217; low, an&#8217; saying
niver so much as a single worrd.&#8221;</p>

<p>They went in this way for a mile or more,
and then Pat declared he knew they were near
the game. Sure enough, peeping up over the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
top of the tall grass in which they were hidden,
the boys discovered that a number of buffalo
were either eating lazily, or else lying down;
for the sun seemed rather hot at this noonday
hour, and the shade cast by the foliage of the
trees felt grateful.</p>

<p>How to crawl close enough to pour in a hot
fire was the question Pat had to decide; but
it did not give him any great amount of trouble
to settle that. He noted which way the wind,
what little there chanced to be at the time, was
blowing; for, in a case like the one now confronting
them, that was a prime factor. Then
they began to glide along like so many snakes.</p>

<p>From time to time they would cautiously
raise their heads, in order to take an observation,
and, so far as they could see, the buffalo
did not appear to be alarmed.</p>

<p>&#8220;We ought soon to be close enough to
shoot,&#8221; whispered Sandy, after he had raised
his head for one of these inspections. &#8220;They
don&#8217;t seem to be afraid of anything right now.
Why, would you believe it, there&#8217;s a sneaking
old gray wolf prowling around there; and none
of them pay any attention to him. Looks like
they only have fear of wolves when they come
in packs.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that ye say; a wolf, is it?&#8221; whispered
Pat; &#8220;whist! now, till I be afther takin&#8217;
a peep at the same.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ten seconds later, and he drew back his
head; and Bob could see that there was a black
frown on the face of the jovial Irish trapper.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bad cess to the luck, it do be surely irritatin&#8217;,&#8221;
he whispered again, as they put their
heads close to his. &#8220;Be careful now, lads, an&#8217;
take another look, to say what that blissed wolf
do be afther.&#8221;</p>

<p>And as Bob and Sandy did so, they saw the
big gray wolf raising up until he almost stood
on his hind legs, while the twang of a bow-string
came to their astonished ears.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI<br />

<small>BAGGING A BUFFALO</small></h2>


<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">There</span> was an arrow shot; I saw it sticking
in the side of that buffalo before it fell over,
after running off a little way!&#8221; whispered
Sandy, excitedly, when both he and his brother
dropped back again beside the Irish trapper.</p>

<p>&#8220;And I saw that wolf holding a short bow!&#8221;
gasped Bob.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! how could that be?&#8221; Sandy exclaimed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Whist! don&#8217;t spake so loud on yees life,
me byes,&#8221; broke in Pat, holding up a warning
finger. &#8220;There do be danger to us all, right
here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Danger!&#8221; echoed Sandy; &#8220;from the buffalo?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;From the Injuns, be the powers,&#8221; added
the trapper. &#8220;Not a worrd now, above the
faintest whisper, do ye mind, till we lay our
plans. &#8217;Tis a ticklish job Pat has on his hands,
so it is.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Indians!&#8221; breathed the startled Sandy;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
and then, like a flash, a look of comprehension
passed over his face. &#8220;Oh! now I understand
what you mean. That old wolf isn&#8217;t what he
pretends to be; but an Indian brave, covered
with a wolfskin.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Glory be! the bye has guessed it!&#8221; chuckled
Pat, who could be amused even when facing
imminent peril.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can we peep again, Pat?&#8221; asked Bob,
really eager to see how the cunning red hunter
managed to accomplish the slaughter of the
great buffalo.</p>

<p>&#8220;Av ye be mighty careful, and do not make
any quick move to atthract attention; becase
the chances are, the hathen do be havin&#8217; frinds
clost by, ready to cut up the game whin he
secures the same. Aisy now, Sandy, and take
it slow. Just the tip av yer nose, do ye mind.&#8221;</p>

<p>Accordingly both boys elevated their heads
until they could just barely see above the top
of the moving grass. The fact that Bob wore
a cap made from the skin of a coon, with several
striped tails hanging behind, while that
perched on the head of his younger brother
was fashioned out of gray squirrel skins, added
much to their security, as they were less likely
to be noticed by watchful eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span></p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 326px;">
<img src="images/i249.jpg" width="326" height="500" alt="two men crouched in brush looking at open plain" />
<div class="caption">&#8220;THEY COULD NOW PLAINLY DISCERN THE FIGURE UNDER THE
WOLFSKIN.&#8221;</div>
</div>

<p>The strange wolf was moving now in the
direction of a buffalo cow, that seemed to be
a little suspicious, since she shook her head
several times, and looked toward the gray animal
as though not wholly convinced that a single
wolf might not mean harm to the herd.</p>

<p>Presently the chance for which the red
hunter waited seemed to come. The watching
boys saw him suddenly rise up, as though on
his knees; and they could now plainly discern
the figure under the wolfskin. He carried a
short bow, and undoubtedly one of great power,
that was calculated to send a barbed shaft half
way through even so great an animal as a buffalo.</p>

<p>Bob was touching the arm of his brother at
the time. He plainly felt Sandy start when
they caught the peculiar &#8220;twang&#8221; of a bow-string,
telling them that the red hunter had
fired his shaft. The buffalo cow started to run
away; but, after going a dozen feet or so, fell
to her knees, tried to rise, gave a low bellow,
and then rolled over on her side.</p>

<p>Some of the remaining animals raised their
heads, and looked in mild surprise; then went
on cropping the grass again, as though their
alarm had been short-lived.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span></p>

<p>The two boys dropped back to the side of
Pat, who had possibly also been watching this
strange panorama, to be seen nowhere else on
the broad earth.</p>

<p>Bob looked at Sandy, and the other returned
his amazed gaze with interest.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you see him do that job, and ain&#8217;t he
able to use that short bow better&#8217;n any Indian
you ever met?&#8221; whispered Sandy.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s why so many of the buffalo look
like they&#8217;re sleeping,&#8221; Bob went on to say.
&#8220;That Indian hunter has been killing them off.
I guess he&#8217;s shot six or seven by now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But what will he do with all that meat;
just eat the tongues?&#8221; Sandy asked.</p>

<p>Bob turned to Pat, a question in his eye, and
the trapper, holding up that warning finger to
make sure that they kept their voices toned
down, so that they could not be heard above
the rustle of the long grass in the breeze, answered
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jerk it for winter use; d&#8217;ye mind?&#8221; was
all he said, but the boys understood.</p>

<p>They had been in an Indian village, and seen
how the surplus venison or buffalo meat was
dried in strips. This jerked meat was stored
away for the time when game might be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
scarce, or the red hunters felt indisposed to
leave their comfortable wigwams to look for it.
And, whenever a runner was sent on a long
journey, this tough meat formed his sole stay
while on the way. It required no cooking, and
a piece put in the mouth could be masticated by
degrees, serving the useful purpose of keeping
the jaws working, and at the same time affording
sustenance to the body.</p>

<p>&#8220;But this upsets all our plans,&#8221; complained
Sandy, who did not see how they were to make
any attempt at getting a buffalo, when possibly
a dozen red hunters were close by, waiting
until their comrade with the short bow and
the killing arrows had completed his bloody
butcher business.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! I doan&#8217;t know,&#8221; remarked Pat, rubbing
his chin with his hand, as though considering
some idea that had crept into his active
mind.</p>

<p>Of course both lads turned eagerly on their
companion. They seemed to view his few
words, and his manner, as suggesting hope.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve thought of something, Pat; please
tell us what it is, for I do hope we can find a
way to get our share of all this meat,&#8221; Sandy
asked, anxiously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;Arrah, now, listen to me, wud yees?&#8221;
whispered the trapper. &#8220;And mebbe afther
all we can sacure what we came out to kerry
home, a pack av juicy mate. D&#8217;ye mind that
the first young bull I saw a-runnin&#8217; off had
an arrow stickin&#8217; in his side; but he managed
to go some distance afore droppin&#8217; to the
ground? Whin I saw him last he was just
passin&#8217; beyant the bunch av timber that stands
to the lift, it might be a quarrter av a mile.
An&#8217;, saing as he niver showed up agin, the
chances are he fell there. Me ijee is to worrk
around in that quarrter, and whin the hunt is
over, and the reds do be busy skinnin&#8217; an&#8217; cuttin&#8217;
up the game, what is to hinder the three
av us from securin&#8217; all we want from the carcase
av the young bull as lies out yonder?
Sure the trees wull be afther consalin&#8217; us from
the eyes av the Injun hunters; an&#8217;, by the same
token, it may be they niver noticed that animal
at all, at all!&#8221;</p>

<p>The proposition struck both boys as a splendid
one. They nodded their heads, and their
eyes sparkled; and Pat needed nothing more
to tell him that his plan met with their unqualified
approbation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hadn&#8217;t we better be backing out of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
then, right away?&#8221; suggested Sandy, always
ready to act.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yis, but be mighty careful,&#8221; advised the
trapper. &#8220;Av we have not been sane up till
now, we doan&#8217;t want to spile the broth by anny
undue haste. Aisy it is, byes.&#8221;</p>

<p>So they retreated in the same track by which
they had advanced, and there came no sound
or sign to tell them that their presence in the
vicinity had been noticed by the other red hunters,
doubtless crouching likewise in the grass,
and waiting for the time to come when they
might burst into view, to take a last shot at
the remnant of the buffalo herd, by that time
alarmed and in full flight.</p>

<p>It stood to reason that these eager hunters
would have eyes only for the game, and this
accounted for the fact that the palefaces had
not been discovered.</p>

<p>Pat would take no unnecessary chances, however,
daring though he was by nature. He felt
a weight upon his shoulders, since he had been
trusted with the responsibility of Mr. Armstrong&#8217;s
two sons; and wished to account
for them both when they came to the boat
again.</p>

<p>By degrees, after going back to the timber<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
belt, they managed to move around until they
had reached a point directly behind the patch
of trees to which Pat had called their attention
a while previously.</p>

<p>&#8220;I saw something there that looked like a
buffalo on the ground,&#8221; whispered Sandy, after
they had been crawling forward again for several
minutes.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all right!&#8221; declared Pat. &#8220;The
young bull niver pulled out at all. And &#8217;twas
his carcase ye saw, sure. We&#8217;re in great luck,
so we be, lads.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! listen to that!&#8221; exclaimed Sandy, as
a series of wild yells broke out.</p>

<p>&#8220;The game is ended, and the balance of the
herd has taken off,&#8221; declared Bob.</p>

<p>They raised their heads to watch, and it was
a sight well worth seeing, with the lumbering
buffalo dashing away in a compact mass, and
here and there an Indian brave popping up
from the long grass, to discharge his arrow at
the fleeing animals.</p>

<p>But they did not seem to drop any, as the
distance was too great; so presently they could
be seen hurrying back toward the spot where
quite a number of slain animals awaited their
attention.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;There must be one to every brave,&#8221; declared
Bob.</p>

<p>&#8220;So much the better,&#8221; remarked Pat; &#8220;av
it kapes thim busy for the nixt hour or so, while
we sacure our mate. This way, lads, and kape
quiet on yer lives.&#8221;</p>

<p>They made their way to the side of the fallen
young bull, and Sandy&#8217;s eyes glistened when
he realized what a piece of good luck had come
their way; when it might just as well have
been a tough old fellow they were given the
chance to carve.</p>

<p>Pat posted each of the boys at a certain spot
to keep watch. They were to give him a signal
if any of the red hunters approached to look
up the animal which had fallen behind the patch
of trees, and which had undoubtedly been
marked by their keen, all-seeing eyes.</p>

<p>There were only about nine of the Indians,
Sandy had said as he left his companions; and
his tone told Bob how he must be figuring on
their chances, should the adventure wind up in
a fight; for Sandy would never consent to abandon
such a fine store of buffalo meat, if it could
possibly be avoided.</p>

<p>From the spot where he was posted Bob
could easily see the Indians working over the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
slain animals that had fallen before the deadly
arrows of the hunter who had made use of the
skin of a wolf, and kept to the leeward of the
herd, in order that they might not catch his
scent, and take the alarm.</p>

<p>He could not but feel a certain thrill as he
watched them work, knowing that, if they
dreamed of the presence of the hated palefaces
near by, they would only too quickly drop their
operations, and go on the war-path, looking for
scalps.</p>

<p>And yet Bob would have been glad to have
had an opportunity to watch how the whole
process of curing the meat was carried out,
because he always felt a great interest in such
things.</p>

<p>He lay there for a very long time, it seemed
to him. At least on three separate occasions
he feared the time had come when discovery
could not be avoided, and that one of the busy
braves meant to look for the bull that had fallen
further off than any of the rest. But, on each
occasion, it proved to be a false alarm, and
Bob found no need of whistling like a quail to
warn Pat, so that the trapper might be on his
guard.</p>

<p>And then, when Bob was beginning to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
very nervous, under the belief that discovery
could not now be long delayed, he caught the
whistle of a gopher, thrice repeated. This had
been the signal by means of which Pat would
let the boys know he had completed his task,
and that they were to join him without delay.</p>

<p>So Bob quickly crawled back, at times taking
to his heels, and bending low, so as to keep
under the curtain of long grass.</p>

<p>He arrived at just the same time as Sandy;
and they were delighted to find that the expert
Pat had not only succeeded in cutting up the
young bull, but had three packs of the best
portions of the meat ready to be transported.</p>

<p>Making use of the trees as a means to hide
their retreat, the three whites succeeded in getting
away without attracting the notice of the
Indian buffalo hunters. Pat had purposely
blinded the trail, as he came along last of all.
He hoped that, when one of the Indians approached
the spot, and saw that the bull had
already been attended to, he would turn around
without making an examination, under the belief
that another of the band had been ahead
of him.</p>

<p>Something of the sort must really have happened,
for, though the boys kept on the alert for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
half an hour, listening, and expecting to catch
shrill yells of anger from the back trail, nothing
of the kind came to pass. And more than
once Bob saw Sandy start when he heard a bird
rustle the grass near by, as though he half
expected to see a feathered head thrust up, and
come face to face with an enraged Indian warrior.</p>

<p>They reached in safety the spot where the
flatboat was tied up, and great was the rejoicing
of the entire company at sight of the
toothsome burdens the three hunters carried on
their backs. Around the little fire that afternoon
the story was told of the wolf that handled
a bow with such deadly accuracy; and the
Yankee boy, Amos Terry, who was something
of a greenhorn concerning all woodcraft, sat
there with his eyes &#8220;as big as saucers,&#8221; as
Sandy expressed it, hardly knowing whether
to believe the tale or not.</p>

<p>But Pat was a little uneasy concerning the
possible coming of the Indians, and made up
his mind to keep an extra careful watch that
night.</p>

<p>Taken all in all, the members of the company
were delighted with things as they found them.
Mr. Armstrong had discovered that the soil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
was of wonderful fertility, entirely different
from that of the Ohio hills where their first
home had been located; the women were pleased
with the countless wild flowers that dotted the
long grass of the level prairie; while Sandy
and Bob already believed that the region near
the Mississippi must be like the Indian &#8220;Happy
Hunting Grounds,&#8221; and that game would be
three times as abundant as they had ever known
in the past.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII<br />

<small>AT THE SETTING OF THE EVENING STAR</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> daring voyagers on the beamy flatboat
knew that no matter how their adventure might
turn out in the end, whether for good or evil,
at least they were now on the home stretch. It
was only a question of a few days before they
would be able to feast their eager eyes on
that great stream of which they had heard so
much.</p>

<p>Their caution did not decrease, however.
They realized that enemies might lurk in the
trees that bordered the river, and even amid
the beds of waving green reeds in marshy
places, which were capable of concealing treacherous
foes, ready to let slip the swift arrow,
or discharge the French guns with which the
unscrupulous traders at the numerous posts
were supplying the various tribes.</p>

<p>Nor was this all they had to fear. The closer
they came to the valley of the Mississippi the
more peril they faced. Indians were had
enough; but, deep down in their hearts, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
pioneers dreaded an encounter with the outlaw
trappers who, belonging to the old-time foe of
England, had ever been a thorn in the flesh
of those who would people the vast wilderness
beyond the Alleghanies. (<a id="Note_11r"></a><a href="#Note_11">Note 11.</a>)</p>

<p>Mr. Armstrong fully expected to have to fight
for his new possession. He believed, however,
that, if they could only manage to hold out
until the second detachment arrived, to augment
their force, all might be well.</p>

<p>As for Sandy, he was daily showing more
and more signs of excitement. The dearest
dream of his life was coming true; and, when
presently he could feast his eyes on the rolling
flood of the greatest of all rivers, he would feel
contented&mdash;for a little while, at least.</p>

<p>They were hardly a day without some new
thrill.</p>

<p>Now it was the sight of an Indian village
in full view on the shore, with the smoke curling
up from several fires, where the squaws
seemed to be curing meat by some primitive
process. Mr. Armstrong imagined that most
of the warriors must be off on another grand
hunt; for, while many old men, squaws and
papooses crowded to the edge of the water, and
loud derisive shouts floated to the ears of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
voyagers, there was no effort made to man the
canoes and attack the drifting flatboat.</p>

<p>Occasionally they discovered some lone brave
in a small craft, hunting the wild water birds
that still remained in quantities at certain favored
places, while their feathered companions
had swept away by millions to far northern
breeding-grounds, to return again in the autumn
months.</p>

<p>Mr. Armstrong made it a point to have one
of the men aboard the flatboat call out something
in French whenever the chance arose.
His object was to make the red hunters believe
that the passengers and crew belonged to the
nation with which the western tribes had long
been at peace. He believed that all such devices
were fair in war times; and that such an impression,
if scattered broadcast among the Indians,
was apt to save the little party from
many hazards.</p>

<p>But they were not always free from sudden
perils that seemed to come like bolts from a
clear sky.</p>

<p>One night they had tied up to the southern
shore, as usual. So far as Pat O&#8217;Mara had
been able to decide, there need be no fear of
Indians, although of course they meant to keep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
up a constant watch, so as to guard against
a surprise.</p>

<p>Supper had been cooked ashore, since they
had become so tired of their confined quarters
aboard the boat that every chance to stretch
their limbs was eagerly seized upon, even
though they realized that the greatest element
of safety lay in remaining back of that stout
bulwark formed by the sides of their floating
home.</p>

<p>The good mothers were busily engaged putting
the smaller children to sleep, while the
men sat around the small fire, smoking and
comparing notes as to how long they would be
in reaching their destination.</p>

<p>It was a subject that they never wearied of
talking about, since all their hopes were bound
up now in building those new homes that they
kept picturing in their family councils. The
men did not mind this roving existence so much,
for they had become reconciled to discomforts;
but the wives and mothers yearned for the conclusion
of the long and wearisome voyage.
They missed all the conveniences of the cabins
to which they were accustomed. In these later
days a housekeeper would be apt to smile upon
learning what little constituted the full assortment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
of &#8220;comforts&#8221; which made up the life
of one of those pioneer women; but it was all
they had ever known, and a spinning-wheel,
with the flax that went with it, meant a supply
of clothing for the family that could be procured
in no other way.</p>

<p>One of the men had been posted at a certain
point where it was believed he would be able
to discover the slightest sign of an approaching
enemy, and the balance rested in full confidence
of their safety.</p>

<p>Bob and Sandy had taken a notion to look
over some of their highly-prized traps which
might need oiling; for they wanted them to be
in the best of condition when they started their
fall campaign in the new country.</p>

<p>They sat so that they might receive the benefit
of the blaze that still kept up, as new fuel
was occasionally added to the little fire, the
evening being rather chilly, considering how
far the season was advanced.</p>

<p>And as they polished, or rubbed some bear&#8217;s
grease on the traps that had seen long service
through rain, snow and fair weather, the boys
talked, as they nearly always did, about the
prospects that were so soon to be realized.</p>

<p>&#8220;Father thinks two more days ought to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
bring us to where the Ohio empties into the
Mississippi,&#8221; remarked Sandy, rubbing vigorously
the while.</p>

<p>&#8220;I only hope he is right, and that two nights
from now we&#8217;ll be camped on the shore of that
wonderful river,&#8221; Bob replied, stopping his
work to critically examine it, so as to see
whether anything more could be done to keep
that particular trap from being eaten by rust.</p>

<p>&#8220;What was that dropped down just beside
you, Bob?&#8221; suddenly asked the younger boy,
staring hard as he spoke.</p>

<p>&#8220;I heard something fall, but I supposed it
was a nut dropped by a squirrel,&#8221; replied Bob,
at the same time placing the trap on the ground
while he leaned over to examine. &#8220;I never
saw the squirrels and raccoons so tame as they
are along here. Really now, I believe they
would almost take a piece of mother&#8217;s hoe-cake
right out of my hand. Where was it you saw
the nut fall, Sandy? Am I near it now? Tell
me when I get warmer or colder, like we do in
that game the girls liked to play back in Virginia.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There, it must have been about where your
hand is now; and&mdash;why, what is that?&#8221; and
Sandy stared with all his might at the object<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
Bob was holding up in his hand. &#8220;An arrow!
An Indian arrow! Oh! some prowling red
wolf has been trying to shoot us down as we
sit here. What a narrow escape you had!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait, Sandy!&#8221; exclaimed Bob, quickly,
and with that vein of authority in his voice
which he at times almost unconsciously assumed
when endeavoring to check the hasty actions
of his younger brother. &#8220;Look again, and
perhaps you may remember seeing just such
an arrow as this before.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sandy sank back in his seat, as though his
sudden fright had passed away.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! it is the same Delaware arrow!&#8221; he
cried. &#8220;Our good, but unknown friend has
once more sent us a warning that danger hangs
over our heads! Pull the message off, Bob,
and let us see what it says! How splendid of
this strange protector to follow us all the way
from our old home, away up the Ohio, to this
new land. What could we have done to deserve
such kindness, such faithfulness?&#8221;</p>

<p>Bob had not been idle all the time Sandy
was talking. As before, there was a strip of
birch bark fastened to the stout reed that constituted
the shaft of the feathered arrow, bearing
the Delaware flint barb.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span></p>

<p>Again were crude but easily understood figures
scratched upon the light brown side of the
bark; this time they were very numerous, and
told a story as plain as though it had been
printed with types.</p>

<p>There was a campfire, and a tied-up flatboat,
which must belong to them. About that fire
a number of people seemed to be leisurely
taking their ease. Stars dotted what was intended
for the sky overhead; and one large
one in particular was just above the horizon,
indicated by a straight line. Many recumbent
figures, with feathers, different in arrangement
from any seen before, adorning their scalplocks,
were evidently crawling up through the
long grass, coming from both sides. They carried
bows and arrows, and a few of them guns.</p>

<p>Sandy looked at the drawing, holding his
very breath meanwhile.</p>

<p>&#8220;It means that we will be attacked by a
tribe of Indians we&#8217;ve never met before,
doesn&#8217;t it?&#8221; he demanded. &#8220;Because, I remember
how the Shawanees, the Delawares,
the Pottawottomies, the Senecas, the Miamis
and the Hurons wear feathers in their hair
when on the war-path, and these are different.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I think you are right, Sandy,&#8221; replied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
the other; &#8220;but an Indian must always
be an Indian to us, if he is hostile. Do you
notice how he has drawn this big star close
down to the level of the horizon? That must
be meant for the evening star up yonder;
and the attack is planned for the time of its
setting.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Which will come in another hour, Bob,&#8221;
Sandy went on, feverishly. &#8220;Come, let us
gather all our traps together, and get them
aboard. I&#8217;ll look after that; and do you show
our father what our kind friend has done for
the Armstrongs for the third time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just what I was going to say to you,
Sandy,&#8221; remarked Bob. &#8220;But remember, you
must not look so excited, for many reasons.
Why, right now, at this very minute, how do
we know but that a number of savage Indians
may be watching us, ready to send in a shower
of arrows if they understand that we have
guessed their game? Go about your work just
as if we didn&#8217;t have the least suspicion of
danger.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will, Bob, you can depend on me; and
what you say is good, hard sense, every word
of it. I only wish I could keep myself held
down, and cool, as you do. But it just seems<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
as though something inside of me is always
ready to jump at the very first sign of excitement.
But there&#8217;s father looking this way now.
Perhaps he has discovered that you are holding
an arrow in your hands, and wonders
where you got it. Please go over and beg of
him to get aboard with mother and Kate right
away. And hold on to your gun&mdash;hold on to
your gun!&#8221;</p>

<p>This last piece of advice was wholly unnecessary,
for Bob was determined to be in a
condition to help defend the boat, should a
sudden emergency arise before the time set for
the attack.</p>

<p>While Sandy hurried to get the bunch of
traps aboard, and return to the shore again,
Bob sauntered over to where his father stood,
and as quietly as possible explained what had
happened.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have a long head, for a boy, son,&#8221; was
what Mr. Armstrong remarked, as his hand
fell affectionately on Bob&#8217;s shoulder; and such
few words of praise always made the boy&#8217;s
heart thrill with pride, for his greatest ambition
was to deserve the commendation of those
who were nearest and dearest to him. &#8220;We
will try to let the men know, without showing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
any undue alarm. The sentry, too, must be
informed, so that he may come in, and be ready
to spring for the boat at the signal.&#8221;</p>

<p>This was soon accomplished. Then, at the
given word, everybody leaped for the side of
the boat. Instantly a scene of great excitement
followed. A gun sounded, and a number of
arrows came hurtling through the air, to strike
the side of the cabin; while blood-curdling
yells arose from a point near by, showing
where the enemy had been crawling up all the
while the voyagers rested under the belief that
they were safely guarded.</p>

<p>Fortunately no one was severely hurt by
these feathered shafts, fired so hastily, and
without proper aim, though Mr. Bancroft, who
had been on guard, and had further to run than
any of the rest, received one through the fleshy
part of his left arm as he climbed up the side
of the boat.</p>

<p>But by now the guns of the whites began to
answer back, and the Indians, who were coming
headlong through the brush, evidently
meaning to follow them aboard, met with such
a hot reception that they were glad to drop
flat, and creep behind trees or rocks.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cut the cable free!&#8221; shouted Mr. Armstrong.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
&#8220;Keep the women under shelter, and
let every gun be ready to repel boarders, if
they come on again!&#8221;</p>

<p>He himself boldly seized one of the push
poles, and threw his whole weight upon it, the
instant the cable had been released that held
the upper end of the boat to a tree.</p>

<p>Arrows hurtled around him in a cloud, and
it seemed as though he must surely be struck
down at any second; but Mr. Armstrong appeared
to bear a charmed life, for he did not
receive even a trivial wound.</p>

<p>The boat was already moving with the sluggish
current close to the shore. It was fortunate
that all these things had been prepared
for at the time they tied up there. In the time
of necessity a second might mean safety or
disaster to those hardy souls who had entrusted
their all to a slender chance.</p>

<p>Seeing that their expected quarry was leaving
them in the lurch, the Indians increased
their fire; and then some of the more rash
among them rushed into full view, as though
meaning to board the craft.</p>

<p>But they counted without their host. Those
frontiersmen knew how to defend their craft
desperately. They never pulled trigger without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
lessening the number of their assailants.
Bob and Sandy were on the firing line, and
had no sooner discharged their muskets than
they set to work with feverish haste to get
another load rammed home again.</p>

<p>Several of the Indians managed to dash
through the water up to the waist, and started
to make their way aboard; but clubbed guns
smote those feathered heads with such unerring
skill that not a single bronzed warrior
ever set foot on deck.</p>

<p>Now the boat was leaving the shore, influenced
by the sweep, which two of the voyagers
managed to work fairly well. The danger
seemed over, and lusty shouts broke from the
lips of the defenders of the craft as they noted
that the scene of the late battle was being left
far behind, with the baffled Indians giving
short, sharp yelps, like wolves that have been
cheated out of their prey.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well done!&#8221; exclaimed Mr. Armstrong,
breathing freely for the first time since he had
heard Bob tell how the warning arrow had
fallen close at his side. &#8220;And now, Neighbor
Bancroft, let us look at that wound you&#8217;ve
received. I can pull the arrow through easier
than break or withdraw it. A painful but not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
a dangerous wound; you must let my wife
bathe it, and put on some of her magic
salve.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I only hope the heathen have not taken to
poisoning their arrows,&#8221; remarked Mr. Bancroft;
and Bob and Sandy exchanged glances.</p>

<p>It happened that, many months before, one
of them had watched an Iroquois brave irritate
a rattle-snake with a pole until he had the reptile
in a furious mood, and then allow it to
strike a piece of fresh meat many times, filling
it with the green venom from his poison sack.
After this meat had become impregnated with
the virus, arrow points were dipped in it and
allowed to dry until each had been thoroughly
infected. But it was seldom the Indians used
such terrible weapons; somehow they seemed
to be bound by some code of honor that influenced
them to refrain from adding to the seriousness
of an arrow wound.</p>

<p>Pat came up, and by the light of a lantern,
held by one of the boys, helped Mr. Armstrong
draw the arrow through the wound, for it was
nearly half-way out, and could not be broken
without additional pain to the victim.</p>

<p>Then Bob&#8217;s mother, who was a splendid
nurse, came to dress the wound, and apply<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
some of her salve, upon which every one relied
so completely.</p>

<p>Bob had been keeping an eye on Pat, who
he saw was examining the arrow closely. As
Pat was well acquainted with the peculiarities
of the many separate Indian tribes, as connected
with their arrows and head-dress of
feathers, Bob felt positive that he could tell
him what he wanted to know.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is no Shawanee arrow, Pat, I take
it?&#8221; he remarked.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s jist it, Bob, me bye,&#8221; the trapper
declared, nodding as he looked up. &#8220;No Shawanee
brave iver made his arrow afther the
likes av that. Sac, I says till mesilf, as soon
as I set me eyes on it, an&#8217; Sac I says shtill.
They do be the manest rids av the whole bunch,
I&#8217;m thinkin&#8217;; though, belave me, I&#8217;d hisitate
to say that same in the prisince av Mrs. Armstrong,
bliss her swate heart for an angel, wid
her healin&#8217; salve an&#8217; her coolin&#8217; lotions, becase
she has been thryin&#8217; to belave that all
the bad Injuns has been lift behint entirely;
whin the thruth be, there&#8217;s jist as many out
along the ould Mississippi as we knew afore.&#8221;</p>

<p>After passing down several miles in the
semi-darkness they anchored the boat off a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
bar, and kept close watch until dawn brought
safety; when the voyage was resumed, with
grateful hearts that another peril had been
safely passed, thanks to that unknown red
friend who had a debt to settle with the Armstrong
boys.</p>

<p>Still another night passed, and again they
slept on board, for the women were averse to
taking any more chances. This brought them
to the day when, according to all the figuring
done by Mr. Armstrong, assisted by what
knowledge Pat O&#8217;Mara had on the subject,
they should be close to the place of the joining
of the two great rivers.</p>

<p>All morning long they kept a vigil. Eager
eyes looked ahead, in the hope of discovering
the mighty stream which had lured them all
the way from their old home far up the picturesque
Ohio.</p>

<p>The afternoon was pretty well advanced
when Sandy gave a whoop that was characteristic
of the lad. No need to ask what made
him leap about so boisterously, waving his
coonskin cap around his head. Every eye
turned in the direction of the expected vision;
and, when they saw the great sweep of water
that lay ahead, with its further shore but dimly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
marked against the western horizon, a silence
fell upon them.</p>

<p>It was indeed the Mississippi that spread
before the eyes of that brave little company,
up to then almost a sealed book to English
colonists, though well known to the French
trappers and traders, whose cordon of posts
from north to south united Canada with the
warm regions of the gulf.</p>

<p>They had finally come to the region where
their new home was to be built&mdash;on the bank
of the Mississippi.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII<br />

<small>WHAT THE DEAD ASHES OF A FIRE TOLD</small></h2>


<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Pull</span> hard, Sandy; father wants to land
at that spot where the big crooked tree hangs
over the water. Pat has told him that it was
there he spent the night a year ago, when he
was here spying out the land and learning
what the Frenchmen were doing in the trapping
line. And he also says it is the finest place
for our new home he knows about.&#8221;</p>

<p>While saying all this Bob was himself throwing
his strength upon the sweep he and his
younger brother were managing, while some of
the men rested, or frolicked with their children
inside the cabin of the flatboat.</p>

<p>They were afloat on the Mississippi, and had
been descending the mighty stream most of the
day. To cross it with only a clumsy flatboat
was next to impossible. It would have been
exceedingly dangerous to have risked the diverse
currents that lay in wait for the incautious
voyager, far out from shore.</p>

<p>Some of the men had even proposed that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
they try to make one of the islands that they
had passed, and where it would seem they
might be free from an attack on the part of
the Indians; but to this Mr. Armstrong would
not agree.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look back, friends,&#8221; he had said when this
bold scheme was proposed, &#8220;and try to imagine
what would have become of us and our
families, had we been on such an island when
the flood came. It was bad enough on the main
land, watching our cabins being undermined,
and carried off; but how much worse had we
been watching the waters slowly but surely
covering the very land on which all we loved
stood, with the raging torrent on every side,
and no means of reaching the shore? For my
part, after what I have passed through, nothing
can tempt me to leave this firm foundation.
True, the Indians and French trappers may
get at us the easier; but we know where we
are, and in the other case we would not.&#8221;</p>

<p>And his words were of such a nature that
even those who had been loudest in exploiting
the benefits to be obtained by resorting to an
island, changed their minds, and would have
none of it.</p>

<p>The boat was brought in without a great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
amount of trouble, for they had been keeping
only a short distance away from the bank while
allowing themselves to be carried along at the
will of the strong current.</p>

<p>Pat was, as always, the first to spring ashore.
While the rest were busy securing the boat,
the trapper was circling around up the bank,
looking for recent signs of enemies near the
spot.</p>

<p>He had claimed it was a well-known stopping-place
for all those passing up or down-stream.
Boats loaded with French trappers might possibly
come along at some time or other; but
already time was bringing about a change in
the relations of the colonists and the sons of
France; and if, as seemed very likely, a break
did occur between King George and his American
colonies, the French would be found taking
the part of the latter.</p>

<p>Indeed, Mr. Armstrong had taken this into
consideration when arranging to carry his family
into the heart of the country controlled and
claimed by the French. He expected to have
some little trouble with them at first; but,
after a little time, they would hear great news
from the sea-coast that would lift the scales
from their eyes, these rough and daring trappers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
so that they would hold out their hands
to make peace with the newcomers, as common
allies against England.</p>

<p>&#8220;How does this suit you, Sandy?&#8221; asked
Bob, when they, too, had clambered over the
side of the boat, and stood on the bank.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is a fine place for a camp, and for a
cabin, too,&#8221; replied the other, looking about
him with kindling eyes. &#8220;Plenty of big trees
to cut down, or leave standing, just as we think
best; and it looks as if there ought to be a
heap of rich furs to be taken along that ridge
back yonder, and the valley that must lie further
on. Yes, I like this place. It is even better
than what I could see, whenever I shut my
eyes, and tried to picture our new homestead
by the Mississippi.&#8221;</p>

<p>They looked out upon the great river, where
rested the bones of the discoverer, De Soto,
and the copper plates he had sunk beneath its
waters when he claimed the whole region for
his royal master; and tears came into the eyes
of Sandy, whose emotions were easily stirred.</p>

<p>&#8220;Higher up there, and a little way back, we
would build our cabins, I think,&#8221; Bob went on
to remark, in his usual thoughtful way. &#8220;One
bout with a flood will be more than enough for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
father. Think of what it meant to us, the
destruction of our garden; the uprooting of
the supports of our cabin; and then the loss
of mother&#8217;s little strong-box in which she kept
her few precious remembrances of the past, as
well as that wampum belt given to us by Pontiac,
when we saved his life. Yes, it answers
all the needs of our little company; and, once
it is decided that we stay here, watch how soon
the axes begin to ring, and the trees to fall.
Inside of three days, we could have a roof over
our heads again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should be glad of that,&#8221; ventured Sandy,
heaving a little sigh as his eye roved toward
their mother, just climbing down from the side
of the boat, assisted by the steady hand of her
husband; &#8220;for mother has grown weary of
this wandering. She wants to have her own
fire to work over, and cook meals for her family,
instead of the whole company.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Suppose we look around a little,&#8221; suggested
Bob.</p>

<p>&#8220;Count me in with you on that,&#8221; agreed the
other, quickly, for it was just what Sandy was
about to propose himself, being fairly wild to
do a little exploring on his own hook.</p>

<p>Of course they carried their guns as they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
left the vicinity of the flatboat, for the pioneer
of that day never knew at what moment he
would have urgent need of his weapons.</p>

<p>Pat was no longer in sight. He had started
to circle rapidly around, and had already covered
so much territory that it seemed as if
there certainly could be nothing near by that
might be dangerous.</p>

<p>A rabbit jumped out from almost under their
feet; squirrels frisked among the oaks that
grew in abundance in the woods; plump partridges
whirred when they happened to stir
the brush, and inside of five minutes these evidences
of the abundance of small game had
Sandy laughing in great glee.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! I guess none of those stories could
have been untrue, brother,&#8221; he declared, as
they glimpsed a deer that had evidently been
lying down near by, and was only disturbed
by their approach; &#8220;why, I came near getting
a shot at that doe; but, when that branch closed
in behind her flank, I thought it would be silly
to fire, with only a chance of wounding the poor
thing. Mother has taught us not to be cruel
when we take our toll of meat, and I am glad
now I did not fire.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe you will have plenty of chances<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
to shoot all you want, if father decides to stay
right around here,&#8221; remarked Bob. &#8220;As for
myself, I fancy that fine ridge just back there.
If our cabin topped that, we could see up and
down the river, just as we used to do, before,
up on the Ohio; but what a different thing the
Mississippi is from its tributary!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; broke in Sandy, just then, &#8220;didn&#8217;t
you hear Pat tell about that other big river
that comes down from the unknown country
away off to the northwest, and empties its
volume of water into the Mississippi not two
hundred miles north of the mouth of the Ohio?
He said it was the real Mississippi, and that
the Indians so regarded it, because it comes
from so far away, hundreds and hundreds of
miles, so that no man knows the beginning, up
in the country of the Crows; and the strange
Indians with the white skin, called the Mandans;
and the Sioux, who, the French say, are
the most savage fighters of all the red race.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bob looked at his brother doubtfully. He
knew something was working on the mind of
the boy, for he was used to reading the signs.</p>

<p>&#8220;You listen too much to these idle tales Pat
tells, Sandy,&#8221; he remarked. &#8220;First thing I
know, you&#8217;ll be wanting to go off and explore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
that other river, where no English settler has
yet built his cabin, and only savage foes lurk.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sandy made no reply, but a flush crept over
his face; and Bob sighed; for he knew that
his brother had even then been indulging in
dreams of some day seeing that other great
river, lying still deeper in the wilderness that
lay toward the land of the setting sun.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pat was telling us that trappers call this
the most favored place for many miles along
the river,&#8221; Bob remarked, as he glanced around
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; added the other, quickly, &#8220;and he
said he had camped here once himself, when
he came to the country of the Mississippi to
see what the Frenchmen were doing, and find
out if it was really as fine a place as others
had reported. Why, even now that looks like
the ashes of a campfire over yonder.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are right, Sandy,&#8221; declared Bob;
&#8220;some one has been in camp here, and not so
long ago, too; for the ashes have never been
rained on; and you remember that just three
days ago we had a long siege of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bob had touched the flaky ashes with the toe
of his moccasin when saying this. Versed in
the knowledge of woodcraft, this was only a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
natural thing for the boy to remark. It fell
from his lips just as readily as a lad of the
present day might read a printed message that
had been left in the crotch of a stick, after the
departure of late campers.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder who they could have been, Indians,
or French trappers heading for the nearest
trading post with their winter&#8217;s catch of
pelts?&#8221; mused Sandy, looking thoughtfully
around him while speaking.</p>

<p>&#8220;The chances are the last,&#8221; Bob replied.
&#8220;If Indians had been here we would see some
signs to tell us of that fact. Chances are they
would leave a broken arrow behind, or some
feathers that were cast aside; and I do not
see any such, do you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, not here,&#8221; replied Sandy, and then
added: &#8220;It seems to me there is something
lying there, in that clump of grass, that has
been thrown aside. Wait until I get it, Bob;
perhaps it may give us a clue concerning the
men who made this fire.&#8221;</p>

<p>Carelessly he stepped aside, and, bending,
picked up the object that had caught his attention.
As Sandy stood staring, Bob advanced
to his side with quick strides. Then he, too,
seemed to have been turned into stone, for his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
eyes were glued upon what Sandy held in his
shaking hand.</p>

<p>The eyes of the two boys met in a startled
look; and it could be plainly seen that they
were deeply moved by the discovery Sandy had
made, close to the dead ashes of the abandoned
fire.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV<br />

<small>A NEW HOME ON THE MISSISSIPPI</small></h2>


<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">The</span> little box in which mother kept her
few treasures!&#8221; exclaimed Bob.</p>

<p>&#8220;And our wampum belt, which Pontiac presented
to us with his own hands!&#8221; echoed
Sandy, as he once more let his gaze rest on the
object he had discovered, thrown aside in the
grass near the ashes of the deserted fire.</p>

<p>&#8220;Those rascally French traders have been
right here on this spot, brother,&#8221; remarked
Bob, glancing around, and unconsciously half-raising
his gun, as though he partly expected
to see the vicious faces of Jacques Larue and
Henri Lacroix peering at them out of the undergrowth.</p>

<p>&#8220;And only a day or two ago, just think of
that!&#8221; exclaimed Sandy, a sudden glow coming
into his face. &#8220;Oh! what if, after all, we
should have the great good luck to meet the
robbers some fine day; wouldn&#8217;t we demand
that they return our property, though? And
if so much as one single thing belonging to our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
dear mother were missing, they would have to
account for it!&#8221;</p>

<p>But Bob shook his head. He did not possess
the same sanguine spirit as his younger
brother, and consequently could not see things
in the same light.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is true they have been here, and lately,
too,&#8221; he remarked, seriously; &#8220;but you must
not allow yourself to hope too much that there
is any chance for our meeting them. We are
far below the mouth of the Ohio River now;
and the fact of their having been here seems
to say that even now these Frenchmen may be
on their way down to the town their countrymen
have started on the lower waters of the
Mississippi, and which they call New Orleans.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But we could follow them!&#8221; exclaimed
Sandy.</p>

<p>&#8220;As well look for a needle in a haystack,&#8221;
observed the far-seeing Bob.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just to think, if only we could have come
upon them while they were seated here, eating
their supper, and never dreaming that those
they had robbed were at their elbows!
Wouldn&#8217;t we have given the wretches a scare,
though, Bob?&#8221; and Sandy gritted his white
teeth savagely, as he stared at the dumb ashes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
just as if they might be to blame for the misfortune
that had befallen the brothers in arriving
too late.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course there is one little hope that we
will yet run across them,&#8221; Bob said, as though
he, himself, wanted to cling to such a shred.
&#8220;Perhaps they may be lingering around this
part of the country, meaning to rest and hunt,
after the long trip they have just made from
away up the Ohio. And if they do, Sandy&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, if they do!&#8221; echoed the impulsive
lad, shaking his gun impressively, so that further
words were unnecessary.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let us go and show father what we&#8217;ve
found,&#8221; remarked Bob. &#8220;Poor mother will
feel so sad when she sees this little box, for
it held a number of pretty trinkets which she
valued more because they were connected with
the past, when her children were small, than
on account of their worth in a money sense.
To think of those big thieves carrying them
around in their pockets or medicine bags; it
will make father furious.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But how does it come, do you think,&#8221;
Sandy went on, &#8220;that, after carrying the box
all this distance, they threw it away here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is hard to say, Sandy; and I can only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
guess at it. Perhaps, now, they liked the looks
of this pretty little casket, which a cabinetmaker
once fashioned for our mother when she
lived in Jamestown, back in Virginia. But, in
the end, it began to get in the way; and, tired
of carrying it, the men took out the contents
while sitting here by this fire, and threw the
box into the bushes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never dreaming that the Armstrong boys
would come along a day or two later, and find
their property again,&#8221; mused Sandy. &#8220;Finding
this box seems to tell me that next we will
be fortunate enough to run across our wampum
belt.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope so,&#8221; was all Bob said, as he turned
around, to return to where the rest of the party
were busily employed.</p>

<p>Great indeed was the surprise of Mr. Armstrong
when he saw what the boys had discovered
on the very spot where they meant to build
their new home. As for the little mother, she
took the quaint casket in her hands again with
a look that told of renewed hope in her heart.
It was all so very remarkable that the final
recovery of the lost articles now seemed to
lie within the bounds of possibility.</p>

<p>The balance of that day was given up to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
settling themselves as comfortably as they
could. Already, the pioneers liked the situation
so much that they were unanimously
agreed upon staying there permanently. Nowhere
could they hope to find a location uniting
more natural advantages than here. Long
years ago the wandering Indians and white
trappers had discovered this fact, as witness
their stopping to pitch their camps in the vicinity.
It was noted as a country teeming with
game, and offering the adventurous settler the
finest soil possible.</p>

<p>Then there was the great river close at hand,
from which considerable of their needed stock
of food might be procured&mdash;fish the live long
year, and ducks and geese during the colder
months.</p>

<p>Everybody seemed fully satisfied that they
could not possibly fare better by continuing on
down the river; while there were many chances
that they would never run across so splendid
a site for a settlement.</p>

<p>That night passed peacefully, and, with the
advent of another day, operations immediately
commenced. They were so wearied of the close
confinement aboard the cumbersome flatboat,
which had really been overcrowded, that all of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
them longed to possess their own homes. Humble
though these log cabins might be, at least
they would prize them highly, with their few
possessions giving the interiors the air of
home, so dear to the hearts of women the world
over.</p>

<p>The merry sound of axe blades biting eagerly
into the trees could soon be heard. Every head
of a family selected the site where he wished
to build his cabin. These were so arranged
that, while the structures themselves were close
together, each had a gradually increasing strip
of land running back, which could be quickly
cleared, so that a small crop of corn and some
vegetables might yet be planted, for the season
was not late.</p>

<p>As they worked, the men always kept their
guns within easy reach. They had been brought
up to know how trouble often springs out of
a clear sky, and did not mean to be taken unawares.</p>

<p>Until the separate homes were completely
done, the women and children lived aboard the
boat, secure within that stout log cabin which
had sheltered them all so long during the cruise
down the Ohio.</p>

<p>Several days passed, and the four cabins<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
were fast nearing completion. Indeed, another
twenty-four hours would see the finishing
touches given to a couple of the rough log
buildings; and that of the Armstrongs was one
of the most advanced, since the two boys assisted
their father considerably in the work.</p>

<p>The chimney was partly built, out of slabs
and mud that would harden with the heat and
smoke until it became like granite. That generous
fireplace they anticipated would ere long
take on the &#8220;homey&#8221; look that had always
marked the gathering place of the little family
after the candle or the crude lamp was lighted
for the evening; though, as a rule, they depended
altogether upon the glow of the blaze
itself for illumination, since the candles, made
mostly from bear fat, were too precious to
waste.</p>

<p>Kate had been greatly pleased with the situation
of the new home in the western wilderness.
Often she had heard her father talking
about what Washington advocated in connection
with giving every survivor of the French
and Indian wars a large tract of fine land in
the bountiful west, and thus start a movement
that sooner or later would oust the French from
that debatable territory. And, when she saw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
the charming nature of the land, Kate felt in
full sympathy with all her father had said upon
that subject.</p>

<p>She spent half her time wandering around,
picking the most wonderful wild flowers she
had ever seen, listening to the birds singing in
the trees, or paddling in the little dugout upon
the sluggish current of the river; for, owing
to a point of land that extended out some distance
above, the eddies had formed what was
almost a great pond in front of, and below,
their camp.</p>

<p>Of course she had been warned many times
to be exceedingly careful, and not go far away;
but, as Pat O&#8217;Mara kept circulating around
the vicinity, and reported seeing absolutely no
signs of Indians, Kate soon lost all fear.</p>

<p>On the fourth day, which was near the end
of the week, the girl had allowed the boat to
drift a little way down the river, as she watched
the shore for a good spot where she might
land and find new treasures in the form of curious
flowers. She knew that the boys had gone
off on a hunt that morning, as there was need
of fresh meat in the camp; and, besides, the
cabin was by this time so far advanced that
Mr. Armstrong declared himself able to complete<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
it, and move in their few possessions; so
that, when they came back, Bob and Sandy
might expect to be invited to take their first
meal in their own home.</p>

<p>The afternoon was half spent, and the sun
well on his journey toward the horizon that
Sandy so often viewed with yearning, because
it held so much of mystery that appealed to his
adventurous nature.</p>

<p>Kate had drawn the dugout up on the sandy
beach, and, landing, strolled into the edge of
the great woods. She had promised her mother
never to go out of hearing of the busy axes;
and even now she could catch their steady fall,
as the men hewed the logs they had secured
from the fallen trees and adapted them for the
walls of their cabin homes.</p>

<p>In a short time the girl had her arms filled
with the most beautiful flowers she could remember
ever having come across. Each new
treasure excited her afresh, and she almost
forgot her promise not to wander too deeply
into the forest, where there was always a
chance that some savage wildcat might be lurking.</p>

<p>Kate had just turned around, meaning to
head back toward her boat again, which could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
just be seen through the forest aisles, when she
thought she heard a stick snap. Turning
around with a half-laugh, under the impression
that it might be her two brothers stealing up
with the intention of surprising her, the poor
girl was amazed and horrified to see a rough
man, whom she immediately knew must be a
French trapper, standing within five feet of
her. Before she could think of screaming a
second man arose from the bushes, and clapped
a hand over her mouth.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXV<br />

<small>THE PERIL OF KATE</small></h2>


<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">What</span> have we here, Henri?&#8221; exclaimed
the man Kate had seen. She was struggling
in the rude grasp of the other fellow, but was
like a baby in the clutch of his powerful hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am surprised, Jacques, at what I have
here,&#8221; was the reply, in French. &#8220;This girl,
she surely must be the same we know lives in
the cabin, up on the Ohio, belonging to our
enemy, Armstrong. Yes, I am not mistaken.
But what brings her down in this country of
the Mississippi?&#8221;</p>

<p>Evidently both French trappers were astounded
to see Kate there. Many hundreds of
miles stood between the little settlement far
up the Ohio and this region; and in those primitive
days this represented an almost insurmountable
obstacle.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look again and make sure, Henri,&#8221; said
the other fellow, himself striding forward to
leer into the face of the terrified girl, who by
now understood that these men were the rascals<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
who had given them so much trouble, trying
to injure both Sandy and Bob, and finally
robbing their cabin home when it was in the
grip of the flood.</p>

<p>Why, one of them was even then wearing the
wonderful wampum belt which Pontiac himself
had bestowed upon the boys as an emblem of
his friendship, and as a protection to their
home against the savage fury of any Indians
who belonged to the great confederation of
which he was the leader.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, what do you say now, Jacques?&#8221;
demanded the first trapper, with a chuckle.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Sacre!</i> it is as you say; hard to believe
as it is, she must be the same girl. Ha! I have
an idea! It may explain the sound of the axes
which we heard such long time on the trail now,
as we come back once more to our old campground.
See, there is the little boat she paddle
down the river in. I begin to scent the truth
now, Henri.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then supposing you inform me as to the
same, since I am groping in the dark,&#8221; demanded
the other Frenchman.</p>

<p>&#8220;It may be that, if we but come closer to
the old camp, we shall find it occupied by some
of the hateful English settlers. I would not put<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
it past them to descend the Ohio in a flatboat,
till they come here. They have the nerve to
face all the French along the Mississippi. And,
Henri, among the rest is our old enemy, Armstrong.
So you see now how the girl comes to
be here.&#8221;</p>

<p>They stared at each other as though hardly
able to believe the facts thus presented by the
shrewd statement made by Jacques Larue.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Kate had almost ceased her struggles,
because she could only with difficulty
breathe, having that broad palm thrust over
her mouth, and gripped, as she was, in the
strong arm of the trapper.</p>

<p>Oh! how she wished that her brave brothers
would only appear just then, and take these
two ruffians to task for all they had done. How
like savages they looked, in her eyes, with their
brutal faces. And Henri Lacroix was not a
bit careful as he held her, so that she might not
scream, and thus give the alarm. What would
they do with her? The very thought brought
a cold chill to the poor girl.</p>

<p>Once Kate had been taken prisoner by a
young Indian chief belonging to the Iroquois
nation, and carried far away to the country of
the Great Lakes. Eventually she had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
rescued by her two brothers, assisted by others,
and brought back safely home. But she would
never forget what she had suffered in mind
during the time of her captivity.</p>

<p>And yet she really feared these two rough
men more than she had the Indians. As she
looked into their snapping black eyes, she
seemed to see lurking there passions that would
stop at nothing, even murder, in order to carry
out any mad scheme to which they had turned
their attention. Even the girl could realize
how Henri Lacroix longed to avenge the death
of his brother, Armand, at the hands of Simon
Kenton, the friend of the Armstrong family.</p>

<p>If she could only manage to give one loud
cry, surely some one would hear; and at any
rate these cowardly French trappers, becoming
alarmed for their safety, would drop her, and
take to their heels, fearing lest the settlers
shoot them down like wolves. But Henri Lacroix
evidently did not mean to give her the
slightest chance to make any outcry, judging
from the way in which he kept his hand over
her mouth.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is no place for us, Jacques,&#8221; he was
saying now, nodding his head in the direction
whence came the steady plod of the axes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;But I hate to go away, and leave them no
token of our good wishes,&#8221; remarked the second
trapper, with a wide grin that somehow
made poor Kate tremble again.</p>

<p>If only they would let her speak, how gladly
would she have promised not to whisper a
single word about their having been near by,
until hours had elapsed, and they had a chance
to get clear away; but Henri Lacroix would
not give her that chance, in fear lest she bring
vengeful foes down about their ears.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ve haf a long bill to settle wif zem boys,&#8221;
remarked Lacroix, in his broken English.</p>

<p>&#8220;It took us some time to strike von blow,
when we lay hold upon zis belt; and when we
come away to ze country of ze Mississippi we
do not expect evaire to set eyes again on zem.
But, <i>parbleu</i>! ze fools follow us here; zey even
dare build zere hateful Eenglish cabins on zis
river zat belongs to ze French alone. Zat is
too much for us to stand. For ze lilies of
France we must strike a blow zat vill tell zem
zey nevaire can remain here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am of ze same opinion,&#8221; declared the
other Frenchman, gritting his strong white
teeth in a way that renewed all the fears of
the captive girl.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span></p>

<p>Were these men even more savage than the
redskins, and would they actually kill her, as
she had heard of others being treated by whites
who had joined forces with the Indians in the
cruel wars that were always in progress?</p>

<p>&#8220;It is plain, when we leave here, we cannot
be trouble with the girl,&#8221; observed Jacques
Larue, in French. Then, as he seemed to allow
his roving eyes to glance toward the river, just
seen through openings in the trees, a grim smile
broke over his swarthy face, while he went on
speaking: &#8220;Ha! I have deescovered a plan
that promises well. It will not only get rid of
the <i>ma&#8217;m&#8217;selle</i> in a fine way, but at the same
time strike a blow at our old enemy, Armstrong.
The boys perhaps may not feel so proud because
they once get the better of your dead
brother, Armand Lacroix, and Jacques Larue.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell me your plan, then; and, since we are
now in a place of much danger, the quicker we
put it into operation the better, it may be,&#8221;
said Henri.</p>

<p>&#8220;Listen,&#8221; the other went on, quickly. &#8220;Let
us bind this girl so she cannot run away. Also
we will fasten over her mouth a bandage, and
that will prevent any outcry and call for help.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, and then?&#8221; asked Henri Lacroix.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;We can lay her in the boat she has down
here,&#8221; continued Jacques. &#8220;Then, after we
have tucked her in, <i>pouf</i>! the little boat sails
from the shore, and is carried down the current
of the mighty Mississippi! Day and night it
floats on, the sport of wind and waves. And
the Armstrongs will never know what became
of the girl!&#8221;</p>

<p>Even the cruel Henri seemed to be a little
disturbed at the inhumanity exhibited in this
plan of revenge; but, as he remembered the
fate of his brother, he crushed any objections
he might have advanced, and nodded his head,
as though agreeing with his mate.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are right, it is a beautiful idea,&#8221; he
declared. &#8220;The only thing that I like not is
the fact that we cannot ourselves see how they
feel when they not be able to find the daughter.
Ah! it is a noble scheme! Let us then begin
the good work by fastening the hands of our
captive.&#8221;</p>

<p>He took out some stout buckskin thongs, of
which every borderer carried a supply, as they
were useful in many ways. Kate tried the best
she knew how to interfere with his brutal designs,
but in the power of those two men she
was as weak as a babe, and before three minutes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
had passed her hands had been tightly
lashed together behind her back.</p>

<p>After that the trapper proceeded to secure
her ankles in the same way, so that she felt
herself absolutely helpless.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now for the beautiful gag,&#8221; said Jacques,
when this part of the undertaking had been
completed.</p>

<p>He took out of the pack he carried a piece
of cloth, which he managed to fasten across the
mouth of the girl in such a fashion that, while
she could still breathe with some effort, speech
was impossible.</p>

<p>At any rate, they apparently did not mean
to bring about her immediate death. Perhaps
they feared lest, in such a case, some of those
hardy English rangers might set out on their
trail, with the determination never to leave it
until they had avenged the fate of Armstrong&#8217;s
daughter.</p>

<p>&#8220;How will that do, Henri, <i>mon cher</i>?&#8221;
asked Jacques, gaily, stepping back to admire
his own handwork, with the air of an expert.</p>

<p>&#8220;Capital! I congratulate you, Jacques, on
being such a good hand at such work,&#8221; the
other answered. &#8220;Perhaps Armstrong will
follow the boat down the river, and rescue the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
girl; but it will put them to great trouble, and
perhaps they will regret raising a hand to injure
Jacques Larue and Henri Lacroix.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You carry her to the boat, while I go ahead
to make sure nobody may see us do the work,&#8221;
and, speaking in this strain, the burly trapper
led off, with Henri coming along in the rear,
bearing the form of Kate as easily as though
she were a sack of feathers intended for a
pillow.</p>

<p>It was found that a little bend of the shore
intervened above, so that the spot where the
settlers must have landed could not be seen.
They caught a glimpse of the extreme outer
edge of the tied-up flatboat, which fact told the
trappers they had guessed truly as to the
means taken by the Ohio settlers in descending
to the region of the Mississippi.</p>

<p>Henri deposited the helpless form of the girl
in the bottom of the dugout. Then, with a
heartlessness that seemed to be a part of their
half-savage natures, the two French trappers
shoved the boat away from the shore.</p>

<p>It was immediately caught by the current
that flowed more swiftly at this point than
above, and began to drift down-stream. The
Frenchmen dared not wait, lest, in exposing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
themselves they be discovered by hostile eyes;
but, with more or less laughter that, reaching
the ears of the alarmed girl, must have added
to her tortures, they turned and plunged again
into the woods.</p>

<p>And the little boat, passing on into swifter
waters, was soon swirling and dancing gaily on
the bosom of the broad Mississippi, bearing
Kate Armstrong further and further away
from all those she held dear.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVI<br />

<small>THE DRIFTING DUGOUT</small></h2>


<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">I think</span> we had better stop and take a
little breathing spell, Sandy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing would please me better, Bob. This
meat pack is very heavy, and it seems to me as
if the air had grown much warmer. Summer
has come, down here, surely. Oh! how good
it feels to throw that burden down, and be able
to stretch my arms, which ache as if they had
a cramp.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But all the same, Sandy, we ought to be
glad that we have been able to knock over that
fine buck, from which all this fresh venison
comes. And we are not greedy in carrying such
big loads, for there are many hungry mouths
to fill, with four families to think of. Let us
rest here, then, and be refreshed for another
spell of walking.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was well on in the afternoon when Bob
and Sandy, on the way home from their hunt,
exchanged these remarks. Each had a large
pack on his back, for, shortly after noon, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
had come across a deer, and succeeded in killing
the animal at the first shot.</p>

<p>&#8220;How far below the camp do you think we
are?&#8221; Sandy presently asked, as he lay there
taking his ease, with his hands under his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hardly know,&#8221; replied Bob, &#8220;but it must
be several miles. My idea was to do the same
as we used to up on the Ohio&mdash;strike for the
river first of all, and try to make our way back
by keeping to the open stretch of shore.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, we are already close to the river,
though perhaps you didn&#8217;t know it when you
said we had better take a rest. See, you can
look out on the water right here,&#8221; and Sandy
pointed as he spoke.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure enough, it is as you say, and that
makes it easier,&#8221; Bob replied. &#8220;I thought that
I had my bearings all right; but, then, we know
so little of this country, and none at all about
the river; so there is always a chance we
might miss seeing it for a long time. So you
understand I&#8217;m glad enough to look out and
see that running water.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This is a fine big buck we got,&#8221; remarked
Sandy, reflectively.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, and as large as any I&#8217;ve ever seen,&#8221;
Bob added.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know how it is,&#8221; Sandy continued,
with a faint smile; &#8220;but something in me just
seems to take a savage pleasure in getting after
<i>big</i> game. Somehow I don&#8217;t care for shooting
partridges or ducks any more. Even a deer
seems tame to me. If it is a big bear, a panther
or a buffalo I think I&#8217;m in great luck. Some
day&mdash;&#8221; and there he came to a sudden stop.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, what about some day?&#8221; demanded
the other, turning to look at him.</p>

<p>Sandy gave a reckless little chuckle, and then
went on:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! I suppose you&#8217;ll just laugh at me,
and say that I&#8217;m foolish to let myself dream
in that way; but it&#8217;s another of Pat&#8217;s stories
that has been setting me to thinking, and wondering
whether I&#8217;ll ever have the chance to
shoot one of those tremendous beasts.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it now, a tiger, a lion or an elephant?&#8221;
asked Bob, scornfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! no,&#8221; replied Sandy, promptly; &#8220;nothing
that can be found outside of this country
and Canada. Pat has seen them many times,
and even been gored by a great bull moose.
You can see the scar on his cheek even now,
where he had a bad wound, by which he almost
bled to death.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span></p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 322px;">
<img src="images/i311.jpg" width="322" height="500" alt="one man pointing down river with other man watching" />
<div class="caption">&#8220;&#8216;YES, YOU ARE RIGHT, SANDY, IT <i>IS</i> A BOAT.&#8217;&#8221;</div>
</div>

<p>&#8220;And you mean to go away up into Canada
to hunt for one of these moose, as they call
them?&#8221; demanded the older brother, incredulously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, hardly that,&#8221; answered Sandy, with
a little hesitation. &#8220;You see, Pat, he says he
believes moose can be found up that other big
river that flows into the Mississippi above the
Ohio. And some day, it may not be for years
though, I hope to see with my own eyes whether
that is true.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We have taken some long journeys, but
that would exceed them all,&#8221; remarked Bob,
thoughtfully; and Sandy chuckled as he realized
that, after all, his prudent brother had
determined that, if ever that trip were undertaken,
he would never allow Sandy to go alone.</p>

<p>&#8220;I feel rested already,&#8221; remarked Sandy,
sitting up; &#8220;and besides, I&#8217;m anxious to get
back to see how things look, with mother sitting
there beside a fire in our new cabin. It will
feel so good to have our own roof over our
heads again. Oh! Bob, what is that floating
past yonder? I do declare, it looks like a
boat!&#8221;</p>

<p>The two sprang to their feet and stared.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, you are right, Sandy, it is a boat; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
yet, for the life of me, I fail to see a living soul
in it. There is no paddle flashing in the sunlight.
It seems to be deserted. Come, let us
leave our meat here, and run to the shore, so
we can see better.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nothing loath, Sandy trotted along at the
heels of his brother, and in the course of a minute
or so they had gained the bank of the river.
It happened that, when Sandy first discovered
the drifting object, it had caught in an eddy
that kept holding it back, so that although some
little time had elapsed, the object of their scrutiny
was still opposite to them.</p>

<p>To discover an empty dugout on the river
was a strange event, indeed. The Armstrong
boys could not remember ever having such a
thing happen before in all their experience;
and it was no wonder then that they stared
and rubbed their eyes as if they could hardly
believe what they saw.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can it be a sly trick on the part of Indians
to keep our attention fastened on that boat
while they slip up behind us?&#8221; Sandy asked,
turning his head to look around him at the grim
forest.</p>

<p>&#8220;But they would not know we were coming
along here,&#8221; interposed Bob; &#8220;and so, you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
see, how could they think to lay a plan like that?
No, we need feel no fears on that score. And
then again, you know, Sandy, our own people
are only a short two miles or so above here.
If the river were straight I believe we could
see them even now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, Bob, where could that boat have come
from? I&#8217;ve a good notion to strip and swim
out after it. We could make good use of another
dugout like ours. And it is just the same
kind of a boat, too, don&#8217;t you think?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was thinking something even more than
that, Sandy,&#8221; returned Bob.</p>

<p>&#8220;What?&#8221; demanded the other, still eying
the strange craft that bobbed and danced in the
eddying currents of the river, as though tantalizing
them, before once more starting on
down the great stream.</p>

<p>&#8220;It might be our own boat!&#8221; suggested Bob.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! how could that be?&#8221; asked the other,
catching his breath, and turning a troubled face
toward his brother. &#8220;They are always so particular
to keep it tied fast to the flatboat, you
remember. Why, no one thinks of using it
these days, for we have all been too busy working,
to think of fishing, or trying for a few
ducks.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;You forget that Kate has paddled around
in it a good deal of late!&#8221; said Bob, slowly.</p>

<p>Sandy became excited at once, just as his
brother had expected would be the case.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! do you mean to say that something
might have happened to Kate?&#8221; he asked, a
tremor in his voice, for the boys were very fond
of their little sister.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not know; I hope not, surely,&#8221; muttered
Bob, looking again out toward the drifting
boat; &#8220;but, if that is our boat, you can
see, Sandy, how strange that it should be afloat
there, and no one in it to use the paddle.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sandy laid his gun quietly on the ground.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t say another word against it, Bob,&#8221;
he remarked grimly, as he started to remove
some of his garments.</p>

<p>&#8220;Be careful, is all I ask you, Sandy,&#8221; Bob
replied. &#8220;They tell us the currents of the
Mississippi are treacherous, and that they
often clutch a swimmer as if they had many
hands. If the boat starts down-stream again,
as I fancy may be the case, I will follow along
the shore, bearing both guns.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sandy hastened to divest himself of all superfluous
clothing, at the same time keeping
one eye on the strange boat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span></p>

<p>He was a splendid swimmer; indeed, the boy
had ever been like a duck in the water, so that
Bob felt little fear about his ability to reach
the boat, and tow it ashore, unless some unexpected
development occurred.</p>

<p>&#8220;Keep out of range as you draw closer,
Sandy,&#8221; he remarked.</p>

<p>&#8220;What makes you say that, Bob?&#8221; demanded
the other. &#8220;It sounds as if you expected
to have to use your gun. Come, do you
think Indians might be lying in the bottom of
the boat, ready to rise up and seize a swimmer,
if he came close; or fill him full of arrows?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Here is a tree that I can easily climb,&#8221;
remarked Bob. &#8220;Wait a minute while I get
up among the branches. Perhaps I can tell
then if enemies are crouching in that boat.
Don&#8217;t start till I come back, Sandy.&#8221;</p>

<p>He climbed like a monkey, and was quickly
in a position where he could take a partial view
of the strange craft&#8217;s interior.</p>

<p>But Bob did not stay there long. Whatever
it was he saw, he dropped down again to the
ground much faster than he had climbed
aloft.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you see any Indians?&#8221; asked Sandy,
now ready to plunge into the water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;No, I cannot say that I did,&#8221; came the
reply, in a perplexed tone. &#8220;But there is
<i>something</i> lying in the bottom of that boat.
It is not a bundle, either, for I plainly saw it
move.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sandy waited for no more.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;m going out and see for myself!&#8221;
he declared, as though some half-formed fear
had commenced to assail him.</p>

<p>Stepping into the water, he hurried to reach
a point where it arose to his waist. Then he
threw himself forward, and began to strike out
with overhand strokes that had many times carried
him ahead of all competitors in the water
races the boys of the settlement used to have,
away back in Virginia, before the Armstrongs
had even thought of emigrating across the
mountains to the new country along the
Ohio.</p>

<p>Bob picked up Sandy&#8217;s gun, and such parts
of his clothing as he had discarded. Then he
started to walk down the shore, because he saw
that the boat had finally succeeded in extricating
itself from the clutch of the cross eddies,
and was once more moving southward with the
steady current of the river.</p>

<p>And meanwhile Sandy was breasting the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
stream with powerful strokes, headed so as to
intercept the floating boat when it came along;
and with a new and terrible fear clutching at
his heart.</p>

</div>
<hr class="chap" />
<div class='chapter-beginning'>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XXVII<br />

<small>ON THE TRAIL</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">As</span> he followed along the strip of open shore,
Bob saw his impetuous brother drawing nearer
and nearer to the floating dugout. He half
expected to see some grim figure start suddenly
into view, threatening Sandy with a deadly
weapon, either gun or bow and arrow.</p>

<p>Now Sandy had reached up a hand and
clutched the side of the boat. He exhibited not
a sign of fear, from which fact Bob understood
that, on getting close, he had recognized the
craft as the one they had brought with them
from their old home.</p>

<p>He saw the other pull himself up, and look
within the boat. What would not Bob have
given to see all that met the gaze of his brother
just then.</p>

<p>Sandy&#8217;s actions rather puzzled him, for the
latter, turning half-way around, waved a hand
toward him, as if to say all was well; after
which he dropped back into the water, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
started to tow the boat in the direction of the
shore.</p>

<p>Eagerly did Bob keep abreast of the swimmer.
Sandy did not try to fight the current,
but was evidently desirous of getting to land
as quickly as possible, regardless of all else.</p>

<p>And when he finally stood up where the water
was shallow, and dragged the boat along, Bob,
in his eagerness, waded half-way to his knees.
What he saw when he looked over the edge of
the boat thrilled him. At first he thought Kate
must have met with some serious accident and
was lying dead. Then he saw her eyes were
open, and that a bandage covered her mouth.</p>

<p>Bob snatched his sister up in his arms without
a second&#8217;s delay, for Sandy was too exhausted
after his swim to do much.</p>

<p>The cloth was hastily torn away, and then
the sharp edge of Bob&#8217;s hunting knife cut the
leather thongs that bound the girl.</p>

<p>&#8220;What does all this mean, Kate?&#8221; cried
Bob, in a voice that quivered with anxiety.
&#8220;Oh! has anything terrible happened to father
and mother, that we find you like this?&#8221;</p>

<p>She shook her head in the negative.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no, nothing has happened to them. It
was the Frenchmen who did it!&#8221; she explained,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
though with some difficulty, since the tight
bandage had hurt her jaws.</p>

<p>Bob and his brother stared at each other.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you mean Jacques Larue?&#8221; demanded
Bob, furiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;And that other rascal, Henri Lacroix&mdash;the
brother of the dead Armand?&#8221; Sandy
added, equally enraged.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied the girl, looking as though,
now that rescue had come, she would not be
sorry to see punished the men who had treated
her so badly.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is a wonderful thing,&#8221; Bob went on;
&#8220;tell us how it happened. Where were you
when they caught you; and how is it you did
not call out?&#8221;</p>

<p>So Kate explained how she had been taken
by surprise, and, before she could say a single
word, the hand of Henri Lacroix had stifled all
speech.</p>

<p>&#8220;And they had your fine wampum belt with
them, Sandy,&#8221; she went on, eagerly. &#8220;He was
wearing it as proudly as if he had saved the life
of Pontiac, himself,&mdash;Jacques Larue, I mean.
And they said that they wanted to pay the Armstrongs
back for much that they had suffered.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And, like the base cowards they are,&#8221; Bob<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
grated between his teeth, &#8220;they set a poor
helpless girl adrift on the river in a little dugout
that might be upset in some cross current,
where the fierce eddies swirl!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And wouldn&#8217;t I like a chance to draw a
bead on either of them right now,&#8221; said Sandy,
looking all around him, as he fondled his faithful
old gun, with which he had done so much
execution among the game of the forests.</p>

<p>&#8220;But we should be on the way home!&#8221; declared
Bob. &#8220;Father and Pat must know of
this new outrage that we have suffered at the
hands of these miserable trappers, who would
rather spend their time stealing game that others
have caught than to attend to a line of their
own traps. If father lets us, Sandy, make sure
we will take Pat with us, and start on the trail
at once.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To regain those little treasures mother
mourns as lost forever; that is just fine,&#8221; said
Kate, eagerly, for she was a backwoods girl,
and could recover quickly, after even such a
shocking experience.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not to speak of our wonderful belt,&#8221; added
Sandy, who was slipping on some of the clothes
he had discarded.</p>

<p>In a few minutes they were hurrying back<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
along the shore. The boat had been pulled up
on the beach and the painter fastened to a convenient
tree, so that the chances were they
would find the craft there, when some one came
back after it.</p>

<p>Neither of the boys felt like paddling two
miles against the current of the Mississippi just
then. Besides, they were anxious to get back
to their father. Perhaps the absence of Kate
might have been discovered by this time, and
considerable anxiety have been aroused.</p>

<p>But, when they came to the spot where their
packs of venison had been left, the boys could
not resist the temptation to obtain them again.
Meat was needed too badly in the settlement
to think of taking chances of the wolves running
off before morning with the entire stock.</p>

<p>They had apparently entirely forgotten about
having been tired before this new and surprising
thing came about. At least, to see the
nimble way in which the two boys advanced
along the river shore, no one would think they
exhibited the least sign of weariness.</p>

<p>In due time they approached the bustling
scene where the men were chopping so industriously.
Toward one cabin that seemed to be
about finished they hastened. Mrs. Armstrong,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
chancing to come to the open door, saw them,
and something seemed to tell her the boys were
bringing bad news, for she waited for them
there, and her face did not seem so filled with
sunshine as it had been when they first sighted
her.</p>

<p>When the story of Kate&#8217;s second abduction
had been told, Mr. Armstrong was furious. He
readily agreed to the proposition advanced by
Sandy, that he and his brother be allowed to
take up the trail of the rascally Frenchmen as
soon as Pat came home, as it happened unfortunately
that the Irish trapper was somewhere
out in the woods just then.</p>

<p>The other men were called in, and Kate told
her little story again. Black looks told plainly
what they thought; and for either Larue or
Lacroix to have been seen by any one of those
English settlers just then, would have undoubtedly
meant his death warrant.</p>

<p>Of course they understood that news of their
coming would now be carried to the nearest
French trading post; but then they had not
anticipated being able to keep this a secret long,
it being the hope of Mr. Armstrong that the
French would recognize in them allies against
England, and thus condone their coming&mdash;perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
extend to them the right hand of fellowship.</p>

<p>Several times Sandy would rush outside to
ascertain whether Pat had shown up as yet.
He had no eyes just then for the cosy interior
of the new cabin. Later on, when this load had
been taken off Sandy&#8217;s mind, he would think
just as highly as any one of the delightful comforts
to be enjoyed beside the family hearth.
Just now he could think of nothing but the miserable
deed of those French trappers, and the
fact that one of them was even at that moment
wearing the valuable belt of wampum. The
great Pontiac had bestowed this upon Sandy,
because it had been a bullet from his gun that
had pierced the arm of a madman who was
about to bring down a war-club on the sachem&#8217;s
head.</p>

<p>The afternoon was going all too fast to suit
Sandy. It would be dark before three hours,
and then how could they overtake the Frenchmen,
who, given such a long start, would get
beyond their reach?</p>

<p>More than ever did he long to once again lay
his hands, as the rightful owner, on that beautiful
belt of sacred shells, which bore the well-known
totem of the big chief under whom the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
various tribes had united against the palefaces.</p>

<p>Almost a full hour was lost in this way.
Then Pat came sauntering in, never dreaming
how his absence had fretted the boys.</p>

<p>Quickly he was made acquainted with the
situation; and, no sooner had he heard about
the two Frenchmen, and how they had treated
Kate Armstrong, than Pat was on fire to take
to the war-path.</p>

<p>So he and the two boys left the settlement.
They headed directly for the spot described by
Kate as the place where she had been surprised
by Jacques and his equally bold companion.</p>

<p>Once there, the trained vision of Pat O&#8217;Mara
quickly found the tracks made by the moccasins
of the men. They followed them to the edge
of the water, where according to the mark made
by the prow of the dugout, it was plainly seen
that the boat had been shoved out into the river.</p>

<p>Pat took up the trail from that point, and
followed it very much as a trained hound might
have done; only the sense of sight had to serve
him rather than that of scent.</p>

<p>Close at his heels came the two boys, each
with his rifle held in readiness for instant use,
in case the enemy were sighted. They could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
not tell but that the reckless Frenchmen might
have concluded to hover around, and wait to
see if any of the hated English settlers tried
to follow them.</p>

<p>But, as the afternoon wore on, and they kept
making steady progress away from the river,
they came to the conclusion that Jacques and
Henri must have had some scheme in mind of
cutting off a great bend in the river, the existence
of which was well known to them. By
making this straight cut across country, perhaps
they were saving themselves many miles&#8217;
tramp.</p>

<p>All of this was of course based upon the supposition
that they meant to keep on heading
into the south, and perhaps reaching the lower
country at New Orleans.</p>

<p>As they walked steadily along, from time to
time Sandy, of course, felt compelled to air his
grievances, and he was always sure of a sympathetic
auditor in his brother.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII<br />

<small>CREEPING UP ON THE QUARRY</small></h2>


<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Isn&#8217;t</span> it a shame that we won&#8217;t be able
to catch up with them before dark comes?&#8221;
Sandy began.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, how do we know that yet?&#8221; returned
Bob.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you really think there&#8217;s any chance,
then?&#8221; asked the other, feverishly.</p>

<p>&#8220;About one in ten,&#8221; answered Bob. &#8220;Something
might cause them to stop, and go into
camp. Then, as evening came on we would
sight their fire, and be able to steal up close to
them. Or it might be one of them could twist
his ankle in a creeper, and have a tumble that
would bruise him so badly he would want to
lie over to rest up. There&#8217;s always a slender
chance of such things happening, you know,
Sandy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! to be sure, I understand all that,&#8221;
return the other; &#8220;but, altogether it&#8217;s less
than one chance in ten of its happening; I think
you might have said twenty, while you were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
about it. But, see, Pat has halted. I hope he
hasn&#8217;t lost the trail. That would finish us, I&#8217;m
afraid.&#8221;</p>

<p>Pat turned to the boys, and they could see
a quizzical gleam in his blue eyes. Bob felt sure
the genial Irish trapper must have heard the
complaining words of Sandy, and was in the
humor to take them with at least a grain of
allowance. He understood the nature of the
lad.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure, they arre thryin&#8217; their level best to
pull the wool over the eyes av anny wan that
undertakes to follow,&#8221; Pat was saying.</p>

<p>&#8220;In what way, Pat?&#8221; asked Bob, immediately
understanding that the trapper had been
reading the signs closely.</p>

<p>&#8220;By some av the oldest thricks a sly fox
iver practised. Av ye look here ye may say
where they jumped on this same fallen tree,
and walked along the trunk a good ways. Go
as ye plaze, I defy yees to diskiver where the
sarpints lift that same tree trunk. But bliss
ye, &#8217;tis as plain as the nose on me face; and
nobody&#8217;d have the laste throuble about saing
that. Come wid me, now, and be afther lookin&#8217;
at the way they jumped from the log into the
bush beyant. Notice how the same is crushed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
down in the wan spot. &#8217;Tis there they landed,
troth; and from that point we must now take
up the thrail afresh.&#8221;</p>

<p>It proved to be just as Pat said. Among the
bushes they easily detected the now well-known
tracks of the two French trappers. They had
undoubtedly run along the tree trunk, and, at
the most favorable part, made a flying leap so
as to land at some little distance away, and in
the midst of a thicket, hoping to thus throw
any possible pursuer off the trail. But the trick
was so palpable and so ancient, that it is doubtful
whether even Sandy himself would have
long been held in check.</p>

<p>Frontier lads early learned a multitude of
things connected with trailing that had to be
known in order to give them equal advantages
with the cunning Indian, or the wise four-footed
denizens of the woods. They understood the
nature of the animal that made certain tracks,
whither he was bound at the time, whether
toward home or in search of his prey; just how
he limped with one of his legs that had likely
been injured at some time; how he crouched in
the snow, perhaps waiting until his intended
quarry came within reach, and then sprang&mdash;to
fall short, because the imprint of his paws<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
lay in plain view and those made by the feet
of the escaping creature were just beyond. In
many ways they could read the story by means
of the telltale tracks. An education may not
always mean ability to talk in Latin, or read
scientific works; both of which would be very
poor accomplishments when out in the great
wilderness.</p>

<p>So Pat was able to follow the Frenchmen,
no matter how many times they resorted to
tricks of this sort. In the first place he had
done similar things himself on many occasions,
and was therefore familiar with them all; and
then again, Pat was on the constant lookout for
trickery, and the instant he lost sight of the
trail, his first act was to look around and decide
what he would probably have done, had
he been seeking to escape under the same circumstances.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s already getting a little dim; don&#8217;t you
think, Bob?&#8221; asked Sandy, after they had been
moving along in this fashion for considerably
more than an hour.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid that&#8217;s so, Sandy,&#8221; returned the
other.</p>

<p>&#8220;And pretty soon Pat will be telling us that
he can follow the trail no longer,&#8221; pursued the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
disconsolate one. &#8220;Then here we&#8217;ll have to
settle down for the night, and wait for it to get
light enough to see, when we&#8217;ll be off in a big
hurry. I wish I could do what Joshua did, you
know, Bob.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Make the sun stand still, you mean,
Sandy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, because that would give us more time
to keep chasing after these rascally Frenchmen,&#8221;
replied the other, with vehemence.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! yes, but you forget that, if the daylight
remained, and they kept on moving all the
time, they would be holding their own against
us, and continuing to play those tricks that so
far have failed to hoodwink Pat.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I hope he will never think of giving
up the pursuit as long as we can find a single
trace of where they have gone. This is the last
chance we&#8217;re ever going to have to get back
that belt; and something tells me that, if we
keep after them, just like the wolf does the
wounded stag, day and night, without ever
quitting, why, we&#8217;re just bound to catch up
with Jacques and Henri&mdash;some time or
other.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait and see what happens,&#8221; was all Bob
would say; but Sandy knew that his elder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
brother had considerable persistency in his
nature; and on this account he hugged a hope
that Bob would want to keep on the track of
the thieves until in the end they were overhauled.</p>

<p>But it certainly was growing dusk rapidly.
Pat had to bend over more and more to see what
he wanted. At any minute Bob expected to
hear the trapper declare that it would be folly
to try to track the Frenchmen any longer, unless
they chose to make use of a torch, which
would be a dangerous proceeding, since they
were apt to attract the notice of any roving
Indian who might happen to be in the vicinity.</p>

<p>And sure enough, Pat presently came to a
full stop, calmly proceeding to charge his little
pipe, at which he puffed with evident relish.</p>

<p>&#8220;The game is up for the night, me byes,&#8221;
he said, calmly. &#8220;We do be havin&#8217; to settle
down here, and wait for the day to come, whin
I&#8217;ll again sthart away. I doubt that the rogues
will thry to throw the dust in our eyes again;
and so we kin make better time, wance we get
stharted. It&#8217;s harrd, I do be understandin&#8217;;
but what&#8217;s the use thryin&#8217; to smash your head
ag&#8217;inst a stone wall? Bitter far, jist take it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
aisy-like, and belave it&#8217;s all a-goin&#8217; to come out
right in the ind.&#8221;</p>

<p>They went into camp. Bob had been wise
enough to bring along a portion of the fresh
venison, so there was no need of any one going
hungry; and Pat took it upon himself to build
the cleverest little cooking fire they ever saw,
so fashioned that, even in the darkness that
came upon them presently, it could not have
been seen twenty feet away.</p>

<p>After partaking of their supper, the three
settled down to spend a long and tiresome night
under the trees of that forest bordering the
bank of the Mississippi.</p>

<p>Sandy slept very little, Bob felt sure, because
every time the latter woke up he could see the
other sitting there, hugging his knees with his
arms, and with an anxious face turned squarely
toward the east, as though desirous of knowing
when the first faint peep of daybreak arrived.</p>

<p>And really it was one of the longest nights
Bob himself could ever remember passing
through. It seemed as though dawn would
never come.</p>

<p>But finally Pat stirred, and, sitting up, announced
that they had better be making a fire,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
if they hoped to have a bite before starting off.
How he knew what the time was might seem
a deep mystery to those unacquainted with the
ways of a woodsman. The chances were that
Pat, who used the heavens for his clock, had
decided that a certain star would be just at a
particular point an hour before daylight, and
this was plenty of time for their needs.</p>

<p>So once more they were on the move, as soon
as the light was strong enough for Pat to take
up the trail.</p>

<p>The two Frenchmen evidently believed that
they had long since baffled any possible pursuer.
Indeed, they could hardly dream that
they would be followed at all. The little band
of English, that had thus boldly invaded the
territory so long claimed by the French, must
be only a weak branch of the rival race; and
surely would never dare venture far away from
their base, lest they be overwhelmed by hostile
Indians.</p>

<p>Consequently, Pat was enabled to make very
good time along the trail, now that he had the
light of day to assist him.</p>

<p>They came upon the ashes of a fire after a
while, showing that the men they were chasing
must have camped not a great distance away<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
from their own resting place, certainly no more
than three miles.</p>

<p>Pat could tell by placing his hand among the
still warm ashes just how long before the place
had been deserted; just as he was able to discover
from the tracks what space of time had
elapsed since the men passed along.</p>

<p>Their caution increased as the morning advanced,
for they realized that they were rapidly
overhauling the two Frenchmen; and, as
these worthies had been spending the better
part of their lives among the Indians and wild
animals of the frontier, it was to be expected
that they were well versed in all the ways of
the borderman.</p>

<p>Noon found them stealing along like shadows.
Pat had announced in a whisper that he believed
they would come upon their men resting
in the heat of the day; and he had hopes
that they might thus take them by surprise.</p>

<p>Ten minutes later he made gestures that told
the two pioneer boys the pleasing news of discovery.
The Frenchmen had indeed halted to
build a small fire, and, having eaten, were now
lying flat on their backs, enjoying a noon nap,
little dreaming that enemies could be creeping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
upon them, just as the sly panther crawls, inch
by inch, upon his prey.</p>

<p>And when Bob and Sandy presently caught
sight of the two recumbent figures they felt a
thrill of eagerness and satisfaction, such as
always accompanies successful attainment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XXIX<br />

<small>THE MISSING WAMPUM BELT</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Creeping</span> along, with their guns held in readiness
for instant use, the three gradually approached
the sleepers. Pat frequently paused
to observe closely. Bob knew what he was
keeping in mind; for the trapper had only
lately been telling a story of how once he had
been followed by a pair of hardened border
renegades, who hoped to catch him asleep and
wind up his career. Pat had managed, before
they came up, to divest himself of certain of
his garments, which he stuffed with dead leaves
and arranged so that it looked as though he
might be sleeping near his flickering fire. And,
when the intended murderers crept near, he was
conveniently placed for opening fire upon them.</p>

<p>In that case the border had been well rid of
a pair of rascals, and many a settler&#8217;s home
rendered the more secure because of Pat&#8217;s ruse.</p>

<p>But the shrewd Irish trapper did not mean
to be caught by any similar trick; and that was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
why he was making positive, as he advanced,
that the two figures were real flesh and blood,
and no make-believe forms. And, when he saw
each of them move an arm or leg, as a fly or
mosquito bothered them, this fact was soon so
apparent that Pat lost all fear.</p>

<p>It had already been fully arranged what the
programme should be, under such conditions.
Pat was to throw himself upon one recumbent
figure, while the two boys covered the other with
their guns, and threatened him with immediate
death unless he held up his hands.</p>

<p>When all was ready, and Pat just about to
carry out his part of the arrangement, Henri,
who, it happened, had been selected for the victim
of the boys, suddenly sat up, and started
to stretch, as he yawned sleepily.</p>

<p>Imagine his amazement at seeing three
crouching figures within a few feet of him,
while two muskets were levelled at his head.
Stricken dumb with surprise he could only stare
and gasp.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Pat was not idle. With a leap
that a panther might have envied he was upon
the second figure. Jacques Larue had not the
faintest chance. Taken utterly unawares, and
at a complete disadvantage, he was as putty in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
the hands of the stalwart Irish trapper, even
though himself a man of sinew.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t so much as move a hand except to
raise them above your head, Henri Lacroix,
or you are a dead man!&#8221; exclaimed Bob,
sternly.</p>

<p>True, these two were only boys, but the
Frenchman knew to his sorrow that they were
to be feared just as much as men. And it was
almost ludicrous to see how quickly he elevated
his hands, and made motions with his head to
indicate that he gave in.</p>

<p>After that it was no hard task to bind the
trappers, though first of all their weapons were
taken. They looked alarmed, as indeed they
had good cause for being, since they had long
been a thorn in the flesh of these English settlers,
and might expect to be treated harshly.
And doubtless they both remembered with regret
how they had just lately done a rascally
deed, for which these three might well demand
their lives as a recompense.</p>

<p>Had they not known that Pat O&#8217;Mara must
have trailed them from the place where they
set the dugout adrift, containing Mr. Armstrong&#8217;s
daughter, Jacques Larue and Henri
Lacroix might have stoutly denied all knowledge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
of the crime. As it was they kept their
lips sealed, and remained mute.</p>

<p>When, however, Bob and Sandy, astonished
and chagrined at not finding the wampum belt
upon either of the Frenchmen, although they
recovered most of the little keepsakes lost by
their mother, demanded to know where it had
been hidden, Jacques took it upon himself to
explain, with many extravagant shrugs of his
broad shoulders; for even in those days his
countrymen, even as now, do considerable of
their talking with gestures.</p>

<p>&#8220;I haf not seen ze belt since last night!&#8221;
he declared. &#8220;Ven I allow myself to go to
sleep she is here about my vaist as before; yet,
<i>sacré</i>! it amaze me to find ven I am open my
eyes dis same morning zat ze belt no longer
adorn my person. So it seem zat while I sleep
some unknown von, he crawl into ze camp, and
take avay ze belt, and me not any ze wiser. I
feel nossings, know nossings, only ze belt she
be disappear.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you not suspect that your friend, Henri
here, might have taken a notion to take the belt
and hide it?&#8221; asked Bob, as soon as he could
recover from the shock which this declaration
gave him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;Zat is exact vat pass through my mind!&#8221;
exclaimed Jacques, eagerly. &#8220;He, himself, tell
you ze same, because him I accuse. But hold
on, he say, let us then examine ze ground, and
know ze truth. So zat is vat ve do, accordingly.
Great is our amazement to learn zat an Indian,
he crawl into our camp as ve sleep. I know
ze tracks only too vell to believe zat it can be
a white man. And I gif you my vord, Monsieur
O&#8217;Mara, zat ees ze truth, ze whole truth,
and nossings but ze truth.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bob and Sandy were grievously disappointed.
Whether, as Larue declared, some
unknown Indian had really crept upon them
while they slept, and were wholly off their
guard, taking only the sacred wampum belt,
as though that were the single object of his
mission; or whether, on the other hand, Larue
had secreted the belt for reasons of his
own, the result was all the same so far as
they were concerned, since the belt was
gone.</p>

<p>After talking it over, they decided that the
two prisoners should be taken to the new settlement.
They hardly felt in a condition to
declare what measure of punishment should
be meted out to such scoundrels; and would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
much rather a council of the elder men decided
this question.</p>

<p>Jacques and Henri seemed very much cast
down. They belonged to a class of bordermen
who believed in the old adage, &#8220;an eye for
an eye; a tooth for a tooth;&#8221; and under the
circumstances had reason to expect nothing
in the way of mercy from Mr. Armstrong,
whom they had attempted to injure many
times.</p>

<p>So the return march was taken up, it being
the desire of the boys to reach their destination
that day, even though the journey continued
into the hours of darkness.</p>

<p>Pat knew that, by taking a bee-line route
across country, they could cut off a considerable
distance. When a bee is loaded with
honey it always rises up, as if to take an observation,
and then makes a direct line for its
hive, even though a full mile away from it
at the time. Many claim that it is a peculiar
&#8220;homing instinct&#8221; that guides the little insect
at such times; but this, on the other hand,
seems far from being the case; since, if the
hive be moved in the night time, the bees, starting
out in the morning, will not return to the
old position, but fly straight to the new.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span></p>

<p>To lose Pat O&#8217;Mara in any woods would be
next to impossible, because he was perfectly
at home there, and, although they were now
passing over ground which he saw for the first
time that afternoon, the accuracy of his deduction
was made manifest just about dusk, when
Sandy declared that he certainly heard the
well-known sound of an axe being used upon
firewood, somewhere ahead.</p>

<p>Half an hour later, they walked in on the
sentry who stood guard, and whose quick hearing,
detecting their advance, caused a peremptory
challenge.</p>

<p>Great was the rejoicing among the settlers
when they saw how successful had been the
chase after the rascally trappers belonging to
that league of French Canadians who were
employed all along the great river in catching
the rich pelt-bearing animals inhabiting that
region, or else trading with the Indians for
their furs.</p>

<p>When Mrs. Armstrong found almost all of
her little belongings returned to her, she was
of course delighted; though this circumstance
was of small value in her fond eyes as compared
with the safe home-coming of her brave
boys.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span></p>

<p>When the story of the missing belt was told,
few believed what the Frenchman had advanced
as the truth.</p>

<p>The general opinion seemed to be that, for
some unknown reason, the pair had secreted
the wampum belt somewhere, meaning to get it
again at a later time. And some of the settlers
were loud in their demand that the men be
forced to confess what had been done with the
belt, which, if only possessed again, was certain
to be a great source of security to the new
settlement. They believed it would be a talisman
calculated to act as a bar upon the passions
of the Indians, as long as the name of
Pontiac was held in reverence by the confederated
tribes of the middle West.</p>

<p>So the two men were tightly bound and
thrust into a cabin that was nearly completed,
being told that their fate would be decided at
a council later on. They acted in a sullen manner,
declaring they had told only the truth;
and that, even though the English put them to
the stake, they could say nothing different.
At the same time Larue took occasion to say
that, should their fate ever become known to
the commandant of the nearest trading post,
an expedition would assuredly be fitted out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
against the new settlement that would wipe it
from the face of the earth.</p>

<p>Mr. Armstrong was uneasy. He knew that
the men deserved death, according to the law
of the border; and yet, for many reasons, he
was personally averse to meting out such judgment
upon them.</p>

<p>He was far from being a bloodthirsty man
to begin with. Then Kate had really not been
injured when in their hands, and he had that
to be thankful for; though their method of
annoying the English settlers by setting the
girl adrift on the river was a cowardly proceeding
that surely merited severe punishment.</p>

<p>Last of all, Mr. Armstrong was really desirous
of making a truce with the French traders
in charge of the posts along the Mississippi.
He could see far enough ahead to realize that,
when the Colonies split with the Mother Country,
the natural allies of the rebels would be
the French. And, as far as possible, he did
not wish to do anything calculated to defer
this adjustment of past differences between
the two nations.</p>

<p>And so it was decided to keep the two men
shut up for a few days, in order that they would
suffer the tortures of uncertainty concerning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
their fate. Then, if they did not confess concerning
the disposal of the precious wampum
belt, the English settlers could hold back their
weapons, and cast them adrift, to make their
way back to the nearest post as best they could;
perhaps with a message to the commandant
pertaining to the news from the seacoast, and
the threatening rupture that was surely coming
between England and her rebellious child in
America.</p>

<p>Accordingly, three days later, the two men
were released, with a stern warning to keep
away from this settlement, if they valued their
lives.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXX<br />

<small>THE MYSTERY SOLVED CONCLUSION</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Bob</span>, despite his long tramp, as well as the
excitement that had been his portion during
that day, felt little like sleeping. It seemed
to him as though something weighed upon his
mind, preventing him from enjoying his customary
slumber. He did not know just what
to make of it, and wondered whether it might
mean that danger again hung over the cabin
of his parents.</p>

<p>When the others had settled down, Bob wandered
forth. It was not his turn to act as sentry,
and so, instead of passing around to converse
in low tones with Mr. Bancroft, who was
serving at the time, he found a place where
he could be comfortable, and there remained,
with his back against the cabin wall.</p>

<p>The night was warm, so that it was no task
to remain out of doors. Besides, Bob was
accustomed to looking upon the star-decked sky
as his roof. Many a time had he and Sandy
slept in the open, with no other covering. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
were hardy, as indeed all pioneer boys had to
be, in order to encounter successfully the privations
that seemed to be their birthright.</p>

<p>Bob, himself, hardly knew just why he had
chosen to settle down there, where he could
observe the door of his father&#8217;s new cabin in
the flickering light of the dying fire. He
seemed to take solid satisfaction in just sitting
where he could keep his eyes upon it, while
thinking about that other home, many hundred
miles away, which they had left forever.</p>

<p>Bob was just becoming conscious of the fact
that his eyes were feeling a trifle heavy, and
wondering whether, after all, he would not be
wise in entering the cabin, so as to seek rest
upon the furs that constituted his couch, when
he suddenly became aware that there was something
moving between him and the almost dead
fire.</p>

<p>Now thoroughly aroused, he bent over until
upon his knees, and eagerly watched. In this
fashion he presently became aware that it was
a human figure, and not a prowling wolf, that
had attracted his attention. It was surely advancing,
slowly yet positively, toward the cabin
occupied by the Armstrongs.</p>

<p>Bob felt his pulses thrill. Was this some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
friend of the prisoners, and did he mean to try
to effect their release? Then why pick out the
cabin where Sandy, Kate, Mr. Armstrong and
the little mother slept, in total ignorance of the
peril that seemed to hover above their heads;
unless, as seemed possible, he knew not where
the captive Frenchmen were confined. And it
added to Bob&#8217;s anxiety when presently he made
the alarming discovery that the silent creeper
was a painted and feathered Indian!</p>

<p>Waiting until the creeper had bent low near
the door of the cabin, Bob launched himself
forward. He landed full upon the other&#8217;s back.
There was an involuntary grunt from the Indian,
and a twisting of the lithe figure; but
either the savage did not wish to resist violently,
or else he realized the folly of trying
to get away from the strong clutch of the young
pioneer, for he almost immediately relaxed his
muscles, and remained there, limp enough.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Bob&#8217;s cries had brought forth,
not only his father and the rest of the family,
but everybody in the settlement. They came
crowding around, the men with guns, ready to
defend their families against a possible attack
of the treacherous red foe.</p>

<p>Great, therefore, was the surprise of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
men when they learned how Bob had captured
the creeping Indian, whose actions would indicate
that he must have had some base designs
upon the Armstrong cabin. His arms had been
hastily secured by one of the men; but he now
stood calmly before them, apparently scorning
to show any desire to flee.</p>

<p>Pat took one look at the prisoner, and uttered
an exclamation of amazement.</p>

<p>&#8220;By the powers, now!&#8221; he cried, &#8220;and
who would be afther expectin&#8217; to say a Delaware
brave as far away from his home country
as this wan?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A Delaware!&#8221; echoed Sandy, in his turn
pushing forward, to stare in the face of the
prisoner; and then he, too, gave a cry.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bob, look here, and tell me if this isn&#8217;t that
same young brave we found with his foot
caught in a crevice of the rock, and nearly
starved to death?&#8221;</p>

<p>And the astonished Bob, after coming closer
to the prisoner, agreed with his younger
brother.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, as sure as you live, it is the young
brave who said at the time when we set him
free and gave him meat, that his name was
Buckongahelas, and his father a chief of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
Delawares. Oh! now we know who sent those
warning letters written on birch bark. Just
as we guessed more than once, it was he. That
was the Indian way of showing gratitude; and
he has even followed us all the way to the
Mississippi, in order to again help us. It is
the strangest thing I ever knew.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, if he is your friend, what was he
creeping up to the door of your cabin for?&#8221;
demanded Mr. Wayne, who did not trust the
Indian nature any too well, and found it difficult
to believe that any redskin could feel
gratitude.</p>

<p>Sandy was already unfastening the thongs
that held the arms of the Delaware behind his
back; and he answered indignantly:</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure that, if you take the trouble to
look, Mr. Wayne, you will find that he was
placing another of his friendly birch-bark messages
under the door of our cabin.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was Bob, however, inspired by a sudden
thrilling hope, who turned to look; and, hardly
had Sandy spoken, than the other gave a shout
of delight, as he snatched some object up from
the ground, where it had been pushed from the
stoop by the hasty exit of the Armstrong family.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;The precious wampum belt, Sandy!&#8221; he
cried in glee; &#8220;see, Buckongahelas has
brought it back to us, and was about to leave
it at our doorstep when I jumped on his
back!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! where do you think he could have
found it?&#8221; gasped Sandy, as he took the gift
of the great Pontiac from the hand of his
brother, and even pressed it to his lips, because
he considered it the greatest blessing the
little colony could own.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stop and think, Sandy,&#8221; said Bob, trying
to control his voice; &#8220;and you will surely
remember what Jacques said about some one
creeping upon them while they slept last night,
taking only the belt, and nothing more. Buckongahelas
did that; and to complete his splendid
showing of Indian gratitude.&#8221;</p>

<p>They all now turned upon the young Delaware,
as though expecting that he should explain
the mystery; which he did not seem
averse to doing, though he evidently knew so
little of English that he spoke to Pat in his
native tongue, and the trapper translated the
same to the colonists.</p>

<p>&#8220;Buckongahelas owes his life to the young
white hunters. When he would have died like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
the old wolf that has lost its teeth, and can no
longer hold fast to its prey, they came and
saved him. More than that, they gave him
meat to take him on his journey to the lodges
of his people.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is not well that a Delaware, and the son
of a chief, should be in the debt of a white man.
Buckongahelas made a vow to the Great Manitou
that he would repay it all. So he hovered
about the home of the palefaces. Many times
he saw them and they knew it not. He had
reason to hate the two French trappers who
came from far away in the land of the setting
sun. He watched, and saw that they meant
harm to the family of the white friends of
Buckongahelas. Again, and yet again, did the
Delaware send messages with warning. Yet
did the bad palefaces steal the belt of Pontiac
away, and flee for the land of the Great
Water.</p>

<p>&#8220;That was bad. Buckongahelas could not
bear to see the grief of his white friends, and
go back to his own lodge. A Delaware knows
no fear. So, when they journeyed down the
beautiful river on their new boat the Delaware
was always near by. Day and night Buckongahelas
kept with the palefaces; sometimes on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
a log floating along, and passing their camp,
but always watching for the two bad men who
would wrong their own kind by keeping the belt
of Pontiac, that did not belong to them.</p>

<p>&#8220;And when the sun went down last night,
the Delaware crept into the camp of the French
trappers, and took away the belt that belonged
to another. Now Buckongahelas feels that he
can go back on the long journey to his own
people. The debt has been paid, and he may
look in the face of his father again. It is
well.&#8221;</p>

<p>And so was the mystery lifted from the
strange friendly warnings that, from time to
time, had been received, when some particular
peril hovered over the Armstrongs. After all,
it was very simple. Both Bob and Sandy understood
Indian nature well enough to know
what a strong hold the question of honor had
upon a brave like the highly-strung young
Delaware. Proud of his own strength and
courage, it galled him to think that he was
under so great an obligation to those two half-grown
white boys; and he could never rest
content until he had succeeded in cancelling
the debt after the manner of his people.</p>

<p>He would not remain even over the night<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
with them, for, truth to tell, Buckongahelas
had no particular love for the whites, no matter
whether they were English or French; and
what history tells about his future exploits
amply proves that what he did for the Armstrongs
was a purely personal matter, and not
because he wished to be friendly toward the
people who were slowly but surely driving his
tribe toward the setting sun. The Delawares
had once inhabited the land near Chesapeake
and Delaware bays, though at that time they
had moved so as to be further away from the
encroaching whites. They now found that the
latter were following on their track in constantly
increasing numbers.</p>

<p>With the recovery of the wonderful wampum
belt the boys no longer feared an Indian
attack, unless something happened to Pontiac
that would remove the famous sachem from the
leadership of the confederated tribes. And
we, who have read the history of our country
in the early days, know that this did not occur
for several years.</p>

<p>The new settlement progressed wonderfully.
It was not very long before they had an accession,
as the several families who had manifested
a desire to follow them to the land of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
the Mississippi joined fortunes with those who
had already built cabins, and were engaged in
clearing and planting the land.</p>

<p>It soon became known to the Indians roundabout
that the all-powerful Pontiac had spread
his protecting mantle over this struggling little
settlement on the bank of the Big Water; and
from that hour they gave the colonists no
trouble.</p>

<p>And the commandant at the nearest French
trading post must have received the message
that Mr. Armstrong forwarded in care of
Jacques Larue, for he sent back word that
there would be peace between his trappers and
the little English settlement on the bank of the
Mississippi.</p>

<p>The two rascally trappers had been greatly
surprised at being let off without punishment.
Perhaps their rough natures were not capable
of comprehending the real meaning of the act;
but they were glad to get away without paying
for their evil deeds; and expressed the
intention of fighting shy of the English settlement
after that. As to whether they would
keep their word or not may be made apparent
later on, when many of the characters who
have figured in this volume may be met again<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
in the pages of a new book, to be called, &#8220;The
Pioneer Boys of the Missouri.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bob and Sandy had good reason to feel satisfied
with the outcome of their little act of
kindness. Of course, it did not amount to much
to them, when they released that young Delaware
from his rocky trap, by means of which
his foot had been held secure for several days;
but, to the mind of the Indian, it was a debt
that must be sacredly paid several fold. And,
whenever they looked upon the magic wampum
belt that stood as a signet of the all-powerful
protecting arm of Pontiac, the boys were wont
to exchange a significant glance, as though to
say that &#8220;bread cast upon the waters will
return ere many days.&#8221; And surely this saying
had been amply justified in their case.</p>

<h2>NOTES</h2>


<h3><span class="smcap"><a id="Note_1"></a><a href="#Note_1r">Note 1</a> (<a href="#Page_5">page 5</a>)</span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">What</span> Sandy said about the extensive boundaries of
Virginia was not surprising; for at this early day, just
before the breaking out of the Revolutionary War, the
colonists had only a vague idea of the next-to-unknown
land that lay to the west. Beyond the Alleghanies,
extending to the far-away Mississippi, the country was
considered to be a part of Fincastle County, Virginia.
Beyond that lay the Northwest Territory, a practically
unexplored country, still awaiting the coming of the bold
adventurer.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap"><a id="Note_2"></a><a href="#Note_2r">Note 2</a> (<a href="#Page_7">page 7</a>)</span></h3>

<p>While the flood which the young pioneers witnessed
may well have been the greatest that the Indians had
ever known, it was probably slight compared with the
annual floods of the present day. Every spring the
Ohio and its tributaries receive a huge volume of
water from the melting snows, and from the torrential
rains which occur at that season, and these spring
freshets are looked upon as a matter of course, and
only commented on when they cause unusual loss of
property or of human life. One of the greatest floods
that the Valley of the Ohio has ever experienced was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
that in the latter part of March, 1913, when property
valued at hundreds of millions of dollars was destroyed
and many hundreds of people were drowned.</p>

<p>As far as possible, disaster is guarded against by an
elaborate system of reservoirs and levees, but a year
seldom passes in which the river does not break through
at some point and flood many miles of the Valley.
The increased volume of the annual floods is ascribed
to the fact that the forests which originally lined the
banks of the Ohio and its tributaries have been cut
down, with the result that the excess of water is not
absorbed by the soil, but comes pouring down from
the hills.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap"><a id="Note_3"></a><a href="#Note_3r">Note 3</a> (<a href="#Page_9">page 9</a>)</span></h3>

<p>Pontiac, a powerful chief of the Ottawa Indians,
is famous as the one Indian who succeeded in uniting
the numerous tribes along the frontier in a well-organized
confederacy for the purpose of driving the English
from the country. The uprising took place in 1763
and the war continued for three years, during which
period the Indians captured practically every frontier
fort except Detroit, which was besieged by them for
many months, but succeeded in holding out against
them. The war is one unending succession of massacres
and Indian outrages, but the Indians were
finally overcome, chiefly through their inability to
persist in an enterprise unless immediately successful,
joined to the jealousies among the tribes themselves.
Throughout the war Pontiac was a most romantic
figure, brave and able, and with all those characteristics
which go to make up &#8220;the noble Red Man.&#8221; Pontiac
was assassinated in 1769 by a Delaware brave who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
had been bribed to do the deed by an English trader
who had a personal grudge against the great Chief.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap"><a id="Note_4"></a><a href="#Note_4r">Note 4</a> (<a href="#Page_55">page 55</a>)</span></h3>

<p>Every one has heard of Boone and Kenton; but
history has but little to tell of James Harrod, surveyor,
pioneer and scout. It is known that, even before Boone
penetrated into Kentucky, Harrod had built himself
a cabin on the site of the present city of Harrodsburg.
Under a gentle and mild exterior, he seems to have
been one of the bravest and most resourceful of the
group of pioneers who contributed so much to the
settling of Kentucky and the Valley of the Ohio. About
the only anecdote of him which has come down to us
is of the time when, single-handed, he tracked five
Indian braves who had destroyed a frontiersman&#8217;s home
and carried off two of his daughters. It seems almost
incredible; but, without aid, he killed four and wounded
the fifth Indian, and returned the girls to their father.
His fate is shrouded in mystery. While in the prime
of life he one day disappeared into the forest, and
never returned, and just how he met his end will never
be known.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap"><a id="Note_5"></a><a href="#Note_5r">Note 5</a> (<a href="#Page_62">page 62</a>)</span></h3>

<p>Whatever feeling the frontiersmen had against the
hostile Indians, it was as nothing compared with their
hatred and loathing for the renegade white men who
joined with the Indians against the settlers. These
men, fortunately few in number, were usually either
desperate criminals whose lives were unsafe in the colonies,
or else degenerate brutes who found life among the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
Indians more to their liking than that in civilized surroundings.
The Indians, as a whole, had many noble
qualities, such as loyalty to friendship and a strong regard
for their word of honor, but the renegades lacked
every good quality, being more cruel, more treacherous,
more brutalized than the Indians with whom they cast
in their lots.</p>

<p>The history of the frontier is full of accounts of these
men, and prominent among them was Simon Girty,
concerning whom many stories are told. McKee is
less well known, but is mentioned occasionally as the
companion of the more famous, or, rather, more infamous
Girty.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap"><a id="Note_6"></a><a href="#Note_6r">Note 6</a> (<a href="#Page_64">page 64</a>)</span></h3>

<p>History tells us that Little Turtle lived and died as
the enemy of the settlers who came out from Virginia
to people the wilderness. Many years later, when he
was sachem of his tribe, and said to be the shrewdest
foe the whites had ever known, it was under his
leadership that the associated tribes&mdash;Wyandots or
Hurons, Iroquois, Ottawas, Pottawottomies, Chippewas,
Sacs, Delawares, Miamis and Shawanees&mdash;came
down upon General St. Clair and his army before daylight,
and won a most decisive victory over the forces
he was leading against their towns of Old Chillicothe,
Pecaway, and others.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap"><a id="Note_7"></a><a href="#Note_7r">Note 7</a> (<a href="#Page_81">page 81</a>)</span></h3>

<p>The Shawanee invariably shaped his flints after the
custom of his people; the Huron, the Wyandot, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
Delaware, the Pottawottomie did his in an altogether
different way. One arrowhead was long; another rather
broad; a third had a small shank that fitted in the
crotch made by splitting the end of the shaft; while a
fourth needed no such appendage, but was inserted
direct, and the two sides of the arrow securely bound,
until the whole was as rigid as though forming one
piece.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap"><a id="Note_8"></a><a href="#Note_8r">Note 8</a> (<a href="#Page_127">page 127</a>)</span></h3>

<p>Boone at this time was held to be the finest borderman
west of the Alleghanies. With his calm, resolute
bearing he impressed every one he met as few men have
the faculty for doing.</p>

<p>Even the hostile Indians felt that he was a <i>real</i> man;
and when, several years later, Boone had the misfortune
to fall into their hands, instead of putting him to
the torture post, or making him run the gauntlet, as
ordinary prisoners were treated, they took him a prisoner
to one of their villages far away in Ohio, where
he was finally adopted into the tribe, and treated with
great respect as a brother. Indeed, he had considerable
difficulty in escaping later on, when he learned
that hundreds of the Shawanee warriors were assembling,
with the purpose of surprising his favorite
settlement, which he managed to reach in time to prepare
it for the defence that has become historic.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap"><a id="Note_9"></a><a href="#Note_9r">Note 9</a> (<a href="#Page_149">page 149</a>)</span></h3>

<p>This prophecy of Bob Armstrong really came true,
since the name of Blue Jacket figures on many pages of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
border history. He never loved the whites as a class;
it was only the Armstrongs whom he had come to care
for; and this explains why, at a later stage of his life,
Blue Jacket even led his warriors against the settlements
that were encroaching on the hunting grounds of
the red men. Those who would know more about this
brilliant young brave, who afterwards became so noted
a chief, must study the accounts of border warfare, in
which his exploits are written.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap"><a id="Note_10"></a><a href="#Note_10r">Note 10</a> (<a href="#Page_209">page 209</a>)</span></h3>

<p>This wonderful man of the border, Simon Kenton,
seemed to bear a charmed life. Many times was he
captured; and on three occasions, at least, made to
run the gauntlet of his foes, while the brush was piled
up around the stake at which they fully intended to
burn him; but he always escaped. He had come to
believe that he was never fated to die at the hands of
the red foe of the pioneers; and this made him the
more rash. Even so valued a friend as Boone was unable
to hold him in check, once he allowed this spirit
of recklessness to have dominion over him.</p>

<p>Once, it is recorded that, just after his funeral pile of
brush had been lighted, there came a furious thunder
storm, the rain putting out the fire, and the crash of
the elements sending fear to the hearts of the Indians.
Then the medicine-man hastened to warn them that
the Great Spirit was angry with his red children because
they had attempted to put to death a paleface
whom the spirits especially favored; and so Kenton
had been put back in the prison lodge again, from which
in time he made his escape, as usual.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap"><a id="Note_11"></a><a href="#Note_11r">Note 11</a> (<a href="#Page_242">page 242</a>)</span></h3>

<p>France and England both claimed this country as
their own; but for a long time those who owed allegiance
to the lilies of France had held sway here, undisturbed,
bargaining with the many Indian tribes, and
assuming all the airs of real owners of these woods and
waters, which fairly teemed with game or fish.</p>

<p>When they learned that the first bold band of English
had braved all the perils that lay in wait for them,
and had even established new homesteads on the shore
of the mighty Mississippi, they were first amazed, and
then furious.</p>
